<small>TWADDLES MAKES A GIFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHERE’S the soap, Norah?” demanded
Meg importantly. “The soap and the
scrubbing brush and a clean towel, please. I
need them very much.”</p>

<p>Norah looked at her calmly.</p>

<p>“And why do you be wanting to take a scrubbing
brush and the soap down cellar?” she
asked. “What are you all up to down there,
anyway? I can’t get Twaddles to go to the
store for me, and Dot has been poking about in
the pantry till she has me wild. What are you
doing anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know, Norah, I told you last
week,” replied Meg. “We’re getting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Thanksgiving stuff ready to take to school; all
the children bring something good to eat and
then it is collected and the poor people have a
Thanksgiving Day dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been poor in my time,” said
Norah, tying on her clean, white apron and preparing
to start her dinner, “but never have I
been so starved that I could eat soap or, for that
matter, a scrubbing brush or a towel, even if
’twas a clean one.”</p>

<p>Meg’s blue eyes widened in surprise, and then
she laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Norah, how funny you are!” she cried.
“You know I don’t want the soap for the poor
people to eat! I want to wash the potatoes for
them!”</p>

<p>And then it was Norah’s turn to laugh. She
laughed till the tears came in her eyes and she
had to take her clean apron to wipe them away.</p>

<p>“Meg, Meg, you’ll be the end of me yet!”
laughed Norah. “Who ever heard of scrubbing
potatoes with soap and water and using a towel
to dry ’em? Won’t Sam snicker when I tell
him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“I don’t see anything funny about that,” said
Meg, edging toward the cellar door. “I want
to take nice, clean potatoes and you wash those
we eat, you know you do, Norah.”</p>

<p>“Yes, child, that I do,” admitted Norah kindly
and her voice was sober though her eyes still
twinkled. “But water and a good stiff brush
will be all your potatoes need. They’ll dry of
themselves and you won’t need the towel; and
the soap would spoil ’em completely if the poor
people should be wistful to have ’em baked.”</p>

<p>“Meg, what you doing? Did you get the
soap yet?” shouted Bobby from the bottom of
the cellar steps.</p>

<p>“Here’s the brush,” said Norah, hastily giving
Meg the small vegetable brush from the shelf
over the sink. “Now be off with you and don’t
let me find water all over the laundry floor
either; drowning Dot in water isn’t going to
help the poor folks.”</p>

<p>Meg ran down the steps and joined the other
children who were exceedingly busy. Bobby
was sorting over the apples in the apple bin
and trying to keep Twaddles from eating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
perfect ones he selected. Dot had filled the
laundry tubs with hot water and was only waiting
Meg’s return to put in the turnips and potatoes
to be thoroughly washed. As for Twaddles,
he was walking up and down before the
preserve closet, munching apples, and trying to
decide which jar of preserves he would choose.
Mother Blossom had promised each of the
children one jar of jelly, jam or canned fruit,
to take to school.</p>

<p>“And Dot and Twaddles may send something,
too,” she had said, when the twins as usual declared
that they never had any of the fun because
they were too young to go to school.
“Meg and Bobby will take your thank-offering
to school for you, twinnies.”</p>

<p>It was warm and dry in the cellar and the
electric light made it bright even though it was
already dark outside at half-past four that November
afternoon. The glowing heater occupied
one end of the cemented room and the
laundry tubs the other. In between were the
vegetable and fruit bins and closets where food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
that would keep through the winter had been
stored.</p>

<p>“Norah says we don’t use soap on the potatoes,”
reported Meg to Dot. “Maybe we
shouldn’t have hot water, either.”</p>

<p>“Course we need hot water,” insisted Dot,
who was already splashed from head to foot.
“Hot water is the only way to get ’em clean.”</p>

<p>“There’s Sam—we’ll ask him,” said Bobby
as someone opened the door of the cellar and
came in, bringing a blast of cold, fresh air.</p>

<p>“Well, you look happy,” smiled Sam Layton,
who ran the car and mowed the lawn in summer
and took care of the heater in winter for
the Blossom family. “What mischief are you
into now?”</p>

<p>“Sam, don’t you wash turnips and things like
that in hot water?” demanded Dot earnestly.</p>

<p>“So that’s it,” cried Sam. “I knew, soon as I
saw the cloud of steam from the laundry tubs,
that something was going on. Are you counting
on washing vegetables in Norah’s pet tubs
and in that boiling hot water?”</p>

<p>“They’re for the poor folks,” explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Bobby, polishing an apple by the simple method
of rubbing it on his stocking. “We have to take
’em to school tomorrow and we want them to be
clean.”</p>

<p>“Very nice and quite correct,” approved Sam
seriously. “But somehow it doesn’t fit in with
my sanitary ideas to wash vegetables where the
clothes are done or polish apples on stockings,
Bobby.”</p>

<p>“I meant to get a rag,” said Bobby quickly.
“Norah will give me one. What shall we do to
the potatoes, Sam?”</p>

<p>Sam explained that he thought the best thing
to do was to borrow a pan from Norah and scrub
the vegetables with the brush in water not too
cold for their hands and yet not hot enough to
shrivel the skin of the turnips and potatoes.</p>

<p>“How you going to get your stuff over to
school?” he asked, when Bobby had gone after
the pan and returned with both pan and Norah,
who declared that she knew she would have to
help them. “Potatoes weigh heavy, when you
try to carry them.”</p>

<p>“Daddy said you’d take us in the car,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Meg. “You will, won’t you, Sam? We
have potatoes and carrots and turnips and apples
and four jars of fruit to take.”</p>

<p>“Then you certainly can’t walk,” said Sam,
shaking the heater and raising his voice above
the racket he made. “I guess I can take you
before your father is ready to go in the morning.”</p>

<p>When the vegetables were all nicely washed,
and the laundry floor mopped up, and Dot
placed before the heater to dry off, since she refused
to go upstairs and get into another dress,
and the apples polished to Bobby’s liking, then
it was time to choose the cans of fruit.</p>

<p>The twins could not make up their minds.
Dot wavered between her two favorites,
blackberry jam and orange marmalade, and
Twaddles insisted on peach butter and mustard
pickles.</p>

<p>“Mother said one,” Meg reminded him.
Meg had her own jar of canned pears she had
filled herself and labeled with a little red label.
“Filled by Meg, October 2,” Mother Blossom
had written, and Meg was eager to give the jar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
away because, as she said, it was something she
had done herself.</p>

<p>“Well, pickles don’t count,” argued Twaddles.
“Pickles are extra.”</p>

<p>Bobby had chosen his favorite strawberry jam
and he was anxious to go upstairs and see if dinner
wasn’t almost ready.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Twaddles!” he urged his small
brother. “We can’t wait all night. Which do
you want, Dot?”</p>

<p>“Blackberry jam,” said Dot, shutting her eyes
and gulping as she always did when she had to
make a choice.</p>

<p>“Children, dinner will be ready in a minute!”
Mother Blossom called down to them.</p>

<p>“Now, you see,” scolded Bobby. “Take the
pickles, Twaddles, and put them over there
with the apples. I have to lock up the closet.”</p>

<p>Bobby took the jar of peach butter out of
Twaddles’ hands and put it back on the shelf.
Then he locked the door of the preserve closet
and put the key in his pocket to give his mother.</p>

<p>Twaddles scowled.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want pickles,” he said. “You’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
mean, Bobby Blossom. I hope the poor folks
will throw away your old apples.”</p>

<p>Twaddles never could stay cross very long,
though, and before dinner was over, he was teasing
with Dot to be allowed to go to the school
the next day with Meg and Bobby.</p>

<p>“Please, Daddy,” pleaded the twins. “We’re
sending things for the poor people to eat and
can’t we go and see them?”</p>

<p>“They won’t be there,” said Meg hastily.
“The Charity Bureau comes and gets the stuff
and gives it to the poor people; don’t they,
Bobby?”</p>

<p>Bobby nodded and Father Blossom laughed.</p>

<p>“Now, Twaddles, don’t begin to see a nice
comfortable walnut bureau like the one in
Mother’s room going around collecting food
for the poor folk,” he said teasingly. “I can see
your big eyes beginning to wonder what a
Charity Bureau is. That is only a name for the
kind men and women who go around taking care
of hungry and cold people.”</p>

<p>But though Dot continued to tease to be allowed
to go to school the next day, Twaddles’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
busy little brain kept thinking about the
“Charity Bureau.” He couldn’t understand—Twaddles
was only four years old—exactly why
men and women who collected food for hungry
people should be called a bureau, and the more
he thought about it, the more tangled up he
became. When bedtime came for him and Dot
he was still puzzling over it and it was not till
the next morning that he decided what he
should do.</p>

<p>Meg and Bobby were seated on the front seat
of the car with Sam Layton, and the vegetables
and apples and fruit jars were carefully arranged
on the back seat, when Twaddles came
running out of the house. Mother Blossom had
said the twins were not to go to school—much to
Meg’s and Bobby’s relief—and Meg at first
thought Twaddles was determined to have his
own way.</p>

<p>“Go back, Twaddles! Mother said you
couldn’t go,” she cried, when Twaddles
bounced on the running board.</p>

<p>“I’m not going! I brought you something!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
gasped Twaddles, breathless from running.
“It’s for the Charity Bureau.”</p>

<p>Meg took the little box, wrapped in white
tissue paper, and Sam started the car. The
twins stood and waved to Bobby and Meg as
though they were going on a voyage instead of
to school where they went every school day
morning, and Meg did not look at the package
till Sam suggested that it might be well to see
what was in it.</p>

<p>“You never can tell what Twaddles is going
to do,” observed Sam sagely, “and if I were you,
I’d want to know what I was taking to the
Bureau for him.”</p>

<p>Meg unwrapped the box while Bobby and
Sam stared curiously. When she lifted the
cover, there lay a bottle of cologne!</p>

<p>“It’s his own bottle, the one he bought with
his own money and Daddy laughed at him so,”
said Meg. “Twaddles does love cologne! And
why do you suppose he wants to give it to the
poor people?”</p>

<p>Sam Layton chuckled.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, this isn’t for the poor folks,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
he explained. “Twaddles said it was for the
‘Charity Bureau’—the poor kid has the bureau
idea in his mind in spite of what your father told
him. Pretty nice of him to give away his own
cologne, though, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Nora had told Sam how Father Blossom had
tried to explain what the Charity Bureau was
to Twaddles the night before, and Meg and
Bobby remembered, too. They laughed a little
at poor Twaddles but it was at the idea of the
cologne bottle to stand on the Charity Bureau,
and not at the little boy himself.</p>

<p>“We won’t make fun of him a bit, will we,
Bobby?” said Meg, as the car stopped before
the school. “Twaddles was as good as gold to
give away his own bottle of cologne, and perhaps
someone will like to have it.”</p>

<small>THE THANK-OFFERINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SAM helped carry the vegetables into the
school and we’ll leave him for a minute,
“toting” as he called it, the potatoes and shiny
apples up the walk, and introduce you to the
Blossom children.</p>

<p>You may already know them and if you have
met them before you’ll remember that Meg and
Bobby had other and longer names, although
their best friends often forgot that Meg was
named Margaret for her mother, and that
Robert Hayward Blossom was Bobby’s real
name, the one he would use when he grew up
and went in business with Father Blossom.
The four-year-old twins, too, Dot and Twaddles,
when they were old enough to go to school
would be written down on the teacher’s roll
book as Dorothy Anna and Arthur Gifford
Blossom. In case you do not know, we’ll tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
you that these four children lived in the town
of Oak Hill, with their father and mother, and
with Norah who had lived with them for years,
and with Sam Layton who lived over the garage
and was right-hand man to Father Blossom.</p>

<p>The first book about the Blossoms describes
the lovely summer they spent at Brookside
Farm, visiting Aunt Polly, who was Mother
Blossom’s sister. The friends they made there
and the fun they had are all told of in “Four
Little Blossoms at Brookside Farm.” The children
would have been sorry to leave Aunt Polly
and the farm if there had not been other exciting
days to look forward to. Meg and Bobby had
to go to school, of course, and their first winter
in the school room, and the persistent efforts
of Dot and Twaddles to go to school, too, though
they were not old enough to be enrolled in any
class, and their final success, is related in the
second volume called, “Four Little Blossoms at
Oak Hill School.” The third book about the
Blossoms tells of the blue turquoise locket Meg
lost and how it was found, and how even Meg
and Bobby themselves were lost, though they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
were also found. The children had some exciting
days in this book, “Four Little Blossoms
and Their Winter Fun,” but all the excitement
ended happily.</p>

<p>As soon as school closed in the spring, away
went the Blossom family for a good time. What
happened to them is told in the fourth book
called, “Four Little Blossoms on Apple Tree
Island.” Living on an island is great fun and
the little Blossoms enjoyed every day of the long
summer. It did seem as though they were
always finding something, and they helped to
find a whole missing family while they were on
Apple Tree Island and also helped to rescue a
girl and two younger children who were “lost”
on another island. They found a great friend in
Captain Jenks who ran the motor boat, and
they might have stayed happily on the island the
whole year round if the same important business
that had brought them home from Brookside
Farm the summer before had not called
them back to Oak Hill the middle of September.
School opened, you see.</p>

<p>Back came the Blossom family and Norah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
was very glad to see them. So was Sam Layton,
who had been working on a farm in Canada
during the summer, and had taken Philip,
Meg’s dog, with him. Sam had had enough of
Canada, he said, and he liked Oak Hill much
better; he had found no one in Canada, he declared,
who could cook like Norah.</p>

<p>Between going to school and playing after
school and taking care of Philip and Annabel
Lee, the cat, and running errands and going
with Father Blossom for rides in the car, the
days passed swiftly and, almost before they
realized it, Thanksgiving Day was just around
the corner. And at Thanksgiving time, the
children in school were asked to bring donations
of food which were taken in charge by the
Charity Bureau and by them given to people
who otherwise might not have any dinner on
the holiday.</p>

<p>And now that you know all about the four
little Blossoms, we’ll go back to where we left
Sam carrying the potatoes and apples into the
school.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” he asked, when he had cleared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the back seat of the boxes and bundles. “All
right, then, I must go right back for your
father. Don’t forget to see that the Bureau gets
the cologne, Meg,” and he grinned.</p>

<p>Sam drove off in the car and Meg and Bobby
ran down the stone steps into the basement of
the school where the thank-offerings were to be
stored. Once it had been the custom of the
school to arrange everything in neat rows on
the platform in the assembly hall, but after a
handsome pyramid of apples had shifted during
the opening prayer and had bumped—one at a
time—down over the edge of the platform and
into the aisles and, another time, a jar of preserves
had burst and stained the green velvet
carpet, it was wisely decided that everything
should be carried into the basement and kept
there.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at all the stuff!” cried Bobby when
he saw the collection of gifts spread out on the
plain wooden tables which were used for lunch
tables on the days when it was too stormy to go
home at noon. “Look, Meg, someone even
brought a turkey!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Sure enough, there was a fat turkey, neatly
folded into a basket lined with orange crepe
paper. One of the pupils who lived on a farm
had brought him as her thank-offering and if
the fortunate family who found that turkey in
their basket Thanksgiving Eve admired the
gift as much as the boys and girls of Oak Hill
school did, there could have been no doubt of
their thankfulness.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, the principal of the grammar and
primary grades, and Miss Wright, the vice-principal
of the primary school, were busy
taking the things the children brought and finding
places for them on the tables.</p>

<p>“What fine, clean potatoes!” said Miss
Wright, smiling at Meg. “You scrubbed those
well, didn’t you, dear? I’m so glad when the
children take special pains to make their gifts
attractive, for I believe the pleasure is doubled
for the giver and the receiver. What is that
in your hand, Meg? Something for the thank-offering?”</p>

<p>Meg had forgotten Twaddles’ bottle of cologne
which she held tightly in her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“My little brother, Twaddles, sent it,” she
explained shyly, blushing a little. “It’s—it’s
cologne, and he meant it for the Charity Bureau.
He’s only four years old and he doesn’t
understand about the Bureau very well.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter laughed and so did Miss Wright,
and the children who were listening giggled.
But in a moment Mr. Carter put out his hand.</p>

<p>“Let me take it, Meg,” he said gently. “I
know just the place for it. One of the Bureau
workers told me yesterday about a poor old lady
who has no one to love and take care of her.
She sits all day long in a ward with seven other
old ladies and we are going to make up a special
little basket for her because she is ill. It will
be a pretty basket with a little tea and candy
and other dainties old ladies like in it and on
the very top we’ll put Twaddles’ bottle of cologne.
How will that be?”</p>

<p>“And I’ll put a bow of cheerful red ribbon
on it,” promised Miss Wright. “Be sure and
tell Twaddles, Meg, that we think it was lovely
of him to send such a gift.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be—he’ll be <i>thankful</i>!” stammered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Meg and then Mr. Carter and Miss Wright and
the children laughed again, but as the principal
said, proper laughing was good for them all.</p>

<p>“Now upstairs with you, every one,” he said
presently, when everything was in order, “the
assembly bell will ring in five minutes and we
don’t want any stragglers. Tim Roon, put that
apple back; I’m surprised I should have to
speak to anyone about touching the gifts meant
for the poor and sick.”</p>

<p>Tim Roon, a boy in Bobby’s room, though two
or three years older than Bobby who was seven
and a half, tossed the apple he had taken from
the table angrily back and it fell to the floor
and rolled under the table. Bobby crawled
under and brought it out and dusted it off carefully
with his clean handkerchief. Then he put
it with the other apples and went upstairs with
Meg who had waited for him.</p>

<p>“Won’t Twaddles be glad about the cologne?”
said Meg happily. “I do think Mr. Carter is
just as nice!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is,” agreed Bobby, “and you could
see he remembers Twaddles. So does Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Wright. Well, I’ll see you at recess, Meg.”</p>

<p>Twaddles and Dot had paid a visit to the
school the term before and it was not likely that
anyone who had met the twins would ever forget
them. Mr. Carter did not and neither did
Miss Wright. As for Miss Mason, who had
taught Bobby and Meg last year and in whose
class Meg was this term, she was always asking
about Twaddles and Dot, and she declared she
quite looked forward to the time when they
should be old enough to come to school.</p>

<p>Meg missed Bobby very much and often
wished that they could go through school in the
same grade. But he was a class ahead of her
and they saw each other only at recess, once the
school day had started. This morning, as soon
as the recess gong sounded, a stream of children
headed for the basement to inspect the thank-offerings
again.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Edward?” Bobby asked a fat
little boy who had dashed to the basement door
and came back lugging something yellow and
round. “What’s that for?”</p>

<p>Edward Kurler was in Meg’s class. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
a good-natured, not particularly quick child,
and very ready to do whatever anyone else suggested.
When he played “tag” with the other
boys, Edward was apt to be “it” the greater
part of the game; but he was so good-natured
he never was known to be cross about it.</p>

<p>“I brought a pumpkin,” he explained, his
own face as round and shiny as the pumpkin
he carried. “I didn’t have time to bring it in
’fore school opened. I guess the poor folks will
like a pumpkin—they can make pies out of it.”</p>

<p>Tim Roon came up to the pumpkin and
looked at it closely.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a jack-o-lantern!” he said in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” nodded Edward. “I had it left
over from Hallowe’en. My uncle made it
for me.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t any candle in it,” said Tim.
“I never heard of a pumpkin lantern without a
candle, did you, Charlie?”</p>

<p>Charlie Black was Tim Roon’s chum and the
two boys usually helped each other when they
planned any mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“No, I never heard of a pumpkin without a
candle,” said Charlie seriously. “And I don’t
think you ought to give one away ’less you have
a candle for it, Edward.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Meg leaned up against the table
and stared at Edward anxiously. They knew a
candle should go inside a pumpkin lantern, too.
The other pupils began to think Edward had
made a mistake and that his thank-offering had
something very wrong with it. Edward felt
that way himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you a candle, if you like,” offered
Tim Roon. “Of course I’ll have to have it
back, but you can have it till school closes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, give it to him,” said Charlie Black.
“Light it for him and let’s see how the lantern
looks. Maybe it isn’t a good lantern.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” agreed Tim, his black
eyes snapping with naughtiness. “Wait a minute,
Edward, and I’ll show you how to do things
right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter had gone over to the grammar
school to see how their thank-offerings were
coming in, and Miss Wright was busy in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
office. There was no one in the basement to stop
Tim Roon as he pulled what looked like a red
candle from his pocket and fitted it in the hollow
pumpkin. He stood the lantern in the
center of a pile of apples and took a match from
his pocket. None of the boys were allowed to
carry matches and they looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll light it for you,” said Tim, touching
the match to the candle he had placed inside.</p>

<p>Meg leaned forward to watch and her pretty
hair was almost touching the pumpkin when
Bobby shouted, “Look out!” and pulled her
back.</p>

<p>Then with a loud noise the pumpkin blew
into many pieces, scattering in all directions and
sending the apples rolling to the floor!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>FOUR GRATEFUL CHILDREN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST as the pumpkin burst, two things happened;
Mr. Carter stepped inside the door
and the gong rang to announce the end of
recess.</p>

<p>Tim Roon shot for the door and the children
followed. Tim was eager to escape the principal
and the others did not want to be late in
returning to their classrooms. But Mr. Carter
stood in the doorway and did not move to let
them pass.</p>

<p>“What was that noise I heard just now?” he
asked. “It sounded like an explosion.”</p>

<p>No one answered and Mr. Carter turned to
Miss Wright who had come downstairs to see
why so many pupils were absent from their
rooms.</p>

<p>“Say to the teachers, please,” he said, “that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
am detaining the children; they will come up
presently.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” whispered Meg to Bobby, “now
he’s going to scold.”</p>

<p>The principal heard her and he smiled a
little.</p>

<p>“Not scold, Meg, unless someone deserves it,”
he said pleasantly. “What was that noise I
heard?”</p>

<p>“The pumpkin blew up,” replied Meg uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“The pumpkin blew up!” repeated Mr.
Carter in astonishment. “Whose pumpkin?
What made it blow up?”</p>

<p>Meg was silent.</p>

<p>“Bobby,” said Mr. Carter, “was it your
pumpkin?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Bobby.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Carter,” said Edward bravely.
“It was my pumpkin. I brought it for the poor
people. But it was only a hollow one.”</p>

<p>“Well, why did you want to blow it up?”
asked Mr. Carter, puzzled. “And what did
you do to it to make it blow up, Edward?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I didn’t do anything to it,” protested
Edward.</p>

<p>“I want to know and I want to know at once,
what caused that pumpkin to explode,” said the
principal sternly and Tim Roon wished suddenly
that he had had nothing to do with it.
“Edward!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” poor Edward replied faintly.</p>

<p>“What made your pumpkin explode?” asked
Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>“A candle,” said Edward, who really believed
that Tim Roon had put a candle in his
pumpkin. “They said a hollow pumpkin had
to have a candle in it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” declared Mr. Carter. “No candle
ever exploded. Who put the candle in your
pumpkin?”</p>

<p>Bobby thought “telling tales” under any circumstances,
the most dreadful thing anyone
could do. He did hope that Edward would not
give Tim away. Tim had the same hope, but
he did not trust the fat boy. Instead, he leaned
against him and pinched him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“You know what will happen to you, if you
tell,” he whispered warningly.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” cried Edward, but the principal’s
sharp eyes had seen Tim.</p>

<p>“So you’re the culprit, Tim,” he said severely.
“I might have known. What did you put in
the pumpkin? Tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>“A firecracker,” replied Tim sullenly.</p>

<p>“Did you light it?” persisted Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Tim nodded. He knew what was coming.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the principal. “I will wait
for you, Tim, while you put the scattered apples
back as you found them and carry out the pieces
of pumpkin. Then you and I will go up to the
office and have a little talk. I think your
father will be surprised to hear that you are
carrying matches in your pocket. You may go
back to your rooms, children, and please go
quietly.”</p>

<p>It was all very well to tell then to go quietly,
but such a buzzing of tongues as sounded
in the halls and corridors as the boys and girls
went upstairs! They talked about how frightened
they had been when the pumpkin exploded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and they talked about what might happen
to Tim and they wondered what made him
think of lighting a firecracker and how Mr.
Carter had happened to come just in time to
hear the noise of the explosion.</p>

<p>“I think it was a silly thing to do,” said Bobby
indignantly. “Meg was so close to that pumpkin
her hair would have been burned if I hadn’t
pulled her back. And now Edward hasn’t even
a jack-o-lantern to give the poor people.”</p>

<p>School closed at one o’clock that day because
the next day was Thanksgiving, and of course
as soon as Meg and Bobby reached home the
twins demanded to know about the thank-offerings.
Twaddles was delighted to hear about
his bottle of cologne and he said that he was sure
it would look nice on the Bureau. As Meg
observed, there was no use in trying to explain
that again to him, so she didn’t try.</p>

<p>When they told of the pumpkin Edward
Kurler had brought and of the trouble Tim
Roon had made for himself, Twaddles listened
breathlessly, but Dot turned up her small nose.</p>

<p>“Huh!” she said scornfully. “I think Edward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
is a very queer boy. Nobody could eat
a hollow pumpkin, could they, Norah?”</p>

<p>“Not a very hollow one,” admitted Norah,
“but neither can I make tarts from a hollow
bowl, Dot. If you don’t stop ‘tasting’ pretty
soon, we’ll have no tarts for tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms were in the kitchen,
helping Norah who was very busy getting ready
for the Thanksgiving Day dinner. Bobby and
Meg had found the twins hovering around the
kitchen table when they came home from school
and they had had their lunch in the kitchen, for
Mother Blossom was in the city for the day and
Father Blossom seldom came home to lunch.</p>

<p>“And now we’ll help you,” said Meg, as soon
as they had finished lunch. So Norah had four
helpers for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I’d as lief have four whistling winds to
help me rake leaves,” said Sam, coming in for
a drink of water and finding Norah surrounded
by willing hands and exceedingly willing little
mouths. “But then, ’pears to me you are managing
to turn out some work, Norah,” and Sam
helped himself to a couple of sugar cookies from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
a golden-brown pile left to cool on a clean cloth.</p>

<p>“You’re as bad as the children,” sighed
Norah, but she gave Sam two more cookies before
she told him to “be off.”</p>

<p>“Sam says he’s thankful it hasn’t snowed yet,”
reported Meg at the dinner table that night.
“He says he wants to finish painting the garage
roof before it snows.”</p>

<p>“What are you thankful for, Meg?” asked
Father Blossom suddenly.</p>

<p>“Tarts!” cried Dot, before Meg could answer,
managing to tip her glass of milk into her lap.</p>

<p>“Dot, you must learn to be more careful,”
said Mother Blossom. “I suppose I ought to
be thankful it wasn’t cocoa you upset. And you
answered when Daddy was speaking to Meg.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think in a hurry,” apologized Meg,
while Dot was being mopped up with a clean
napkin. “Could you wait a minute, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask you again tomorrow morning,” said
Father Blossom. “I’ll expect each one of you
to be able to tell me then why you are thankful.
Think it over carefully and then you’ll be ready.”</p>

<p>“Why am I thankful?” said Meg to herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
over and over that evening till bedtime came.
“Why am I thankful, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy!” Bobby called down over the
banisters, after he was supposed to be in bed.
“Daddy! Is it just the same to think why you
are thankful and what you are thankful for?”</p>

<p>“Just about the same,” answered Father
Blossom. “If you think about what you are
thankful <i>for</i> you’ll soon know <i>why</i> you are
thankful. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” said Bobby doubtfully and
he went back to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning the four little Blossoms found
a chocolate turkey at each plate and Mother
Blossom explained that they were a present
from Daddy.</p>

<p>“Well, who can tell me for what they’re
thankful?” asked Father Blossom, as Norah
brought in the oatmeal.</p>

<p>“I know, Daddy!” cried Twaddles. “I’m
thankful I found Bobby’s knife.”</p>

<p>“You found my knife?” said Bobby, frowning.
“You found my knife? Why, my knife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
isn’t lost—I left in the top drawer of my desk
in my room.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you did,” admitted Twaddles,
“and I borrowed it to whittle a new mast for
my boat and I couldn’t remember where I left
it. But Norah found it on the back stoop,” concluded
Twaddles cheerfully.</p>

<p>“If you don’t leave my things alone!” began
Bobby wrathfully. “I’ll—I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Now we won’t have any quarrels Thanksgiving
morning,” said Father Blossom quietly.
“Bobby, suppose you tell me what you are
thankful for.”</p>

<p>“For turkey,” said Bobby promptly, forgetting
to be angry at Twaddles as he remembered
the plump bird he had seen hanging in the
“cold room” where Norah kept her food supplies
and the refrigerator.</p>

<p>“I’m thankful for the maple sugar Aunt
Polly sent us,” cried Dot. “You said we could
have a piece after breakfast, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Meg?” asked Father Blossom. “What are
you thinking of, dear?”</p>

<p>Meg raised her blue eyes and smiled sunnily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“I’m thankful Mr. and Mrs. Harley and Dick
and Herbert found each other,” she said simply.</p>

<p>Meg, you see, remembered the Harleys who
had once lived on Apple Tree Island and the
trouble and sorrow they had known when the
family was separated.</p>

<p>“I think we’re all thankful for the Harleys,”
said Mother Blossom, “and I’m thankful for
my whole Blossom family this morning!”</p>

<p>Thanksgiving dinner was to be at one o’clock
and little Miss Florence, the dressmaker, was
coming, and Mrs. Jordan and her lame son
Paul, for whom the four little Blossoms had
once given a fair.</p>

<p>“If we can’t have Aunt Polly, or any of the
dear farm folk, at least we can make a happy
day for someone else,” Mother Blossom had
said, when she sent Bobby to invite Miss Florence
and Mrs. Jordan.</p>

<p>“And after dinner, I’ll take everyone for a
ride,” promised Father Blossom, “that is, if it
doesn’t snow.”</p>

<p>So the four children spent their morning between
the kitchen, where Norah and Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Blossom were cooking the most delicious smelling
things to eat, and the garage, where Father
Blossom and Sam were going over the car to
make sure that it would be in good order for
the drive that afternoon.</p>

<p>“It’s my turn to sit up with you, isn’t it, Sam?”
asked Dot eagerly. “You always take Meg,
but it is my turn, really it is.”</p>

<p>“Your father is going to drive,” replied Sam
to this. “I’m going to lend Norah a hand with
all the dinner dishes. You can argue with him
about riding on the front seat, Dot.”</p>

<p>Though Father Blossom had bought the car
the spring before, the four little Blossoms still
argued about whose turn it was to ride with the
driver nearly every time they went for a ride.
They had a system of “taking turns,” but this
did not always prevent friction because sometimes
the twins both squeezed into the front seat
and then neither one was willing to admit that
“counted.” As a rule, though, they settled the
dispute amiably and without any suggestion
from Sam or Father Blossom.</p>

<p>“Mother says we must come in and put on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
best dresses, Dot,” said Meg, coming back to
the garage from a trip to the kitchen. “The
table is all set and it’s most time for the company
to come.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m coming,” Dot answered,
brushing past Father Blossom who was washing
his hands at the lavatory in one corner of the
garage.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Dot,” he said, catching hold
of her blouse. “What on earth have you in
your pockets, child?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>DRIVING WITH DADDY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DOT wore a blue serge sailor suit and she
had four pockets, two in the skirt and two
in the blouse, and in addition there were two
pockets in the blue reefer coat she wore.
Apparently all six pockets were stuffed full of
something.</p>

<p>“Mother said you shouldn’t put things in the
pockets of your cloth dress,” Meg told her little
sister. “They get stuck up and gummy and she
can’t clean them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I was going to wear this
dress all day,” explained Dot, looking earnestly
at Father Blossom, “so I wanted some raisins in
case anyone was hungry while we’re out driving
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Dot showed them her coat pockets stuffed with
raisins, packed in so tightly that they made two
hard lumps. It was these hard lumps Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Blossom had felt when she brushed past him.</p>

<p>“What’s that in your blouse?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“My choc’late turkey,” said Dot. Alas, the
chocolate had melted and the turkey was now
sadly mixed with blue serge and red flannel.</p>

<p>“What’s in the other pocket?” suggested
Twaddles.</p>

<p>Dot looked a little confused.</p>

<p>“Cookies,” she said. “I thought Norah
wouldn’t mind. I only took three.”</p>

<p>“And both her skirt pockets are stuffed full
of nuts!” announced Meg, who had been examining
them. “Salted nuts. I’ll bet you didn’t
ask Mother if you could have them, either.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was going to afterward,” said Dot,
half crying. “I didn’t eat a single thing. I
was saving them for folks to have this afternoon.
So there!”</p>

<p>“Run along in and get ready for dinner,”
directed Father Blossom, trying not to look at
Sam, lest he laugh. “Next time, ask Mother,
Dot; you are old enough to know you mustn’t
help yourself to food without asking.”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom sighed a little over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
stuffed pockets, for Dot’s dresses seemed to be
always in need of cleaning and repairing. But
she said that she knew her little girl had not
meant to be careless and that no one should be
scolded on Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>“And I don’t believe even you will be hungry
after you eat the dinner Norah has for us,” said
Mother Blossom smiling as she tied Dot’s pretty
new red hair-ribbon on the thick dark hair.
“There is the bell—suppose you run down, Dot,
and that will save Norah a trip to the door.”</p>

<p>Dot, looking very neat and pretty in her red
and white dotted challis dress, danced downstairs
to let Miss Florence in. Dot had such
dark hair and eyes that all shades of red just
suited her. Meg’s frock was blue and white
challis and her hair-ribbon matched her blue
eyes.</p>

<p>By the time old Mrs. Jordan and the lame
Paul had arrived and had warmed their cold
hands at the blazing wood fire in the living-room,
Norah said dinner was ready. And such
a dinner as it was! Aunt Polly had sent the
turkey from Brookside Farm and most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
vegetables, too! And the currant jelly was the
reddest you ever saw, and certainly the pumpkin
pie was the yellowest! Pale little Miss Florence,
who sewed all day long, day after day,
week after week, for the people in Oak Hill
and who had no family of her own to love her,
said she had never tasted such delicious stuffing
as came out of the big brown turkey, and as for
Mrs. Jordan and Paul they ate as though a
good dinner was a solemn and important affair,
and perhaps it was to them.</p>

<p>“It isn’t snowing, is it, Daddy?” said Twaddles,
the moment dinner was over.</p>

<p>“No, I shouldn’t say it was actually snowing,”
answered Father Blossom teasingly, “but it
looks very much to me as though it might snow.
The paper said snow today and those clouds are
pretty heavy.”</p>

<p>“But you said if it didn’t snow, you’d take
us,” urged Bobby. “Didn’t he, Meg?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Meg. “Yes, you did, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Then I must keep my word,” said Father
Blossom gravely. “Mother, have you enough
wraps to keep us all warm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Mother Blossom had brought down heavy
coats and robes and blankets early that morning,
and now she and Norah began to wrap up the
guests to make them comfortable for the drive.
Father Blossom’s car was big and roomy, with
side curtains that could be put up in case of a
storm, but it was not a closed car. All the
Blossoms were fond of plenty of fresh air and
they liked to be warmly bundled up and then
to ride through the wind and cold and come
home with rosy cheeks and bright eyes and,
goodness, such appetites!</p>

<p>Sam brought the car around and first Mrs.
Jordan was helped in, then Paul next to her,
and then little Miss Florence who, as Father
Blossom said, hardly took up any room at all.
Mother Blossom took one of the folding seats
and Meg the other. Meg wanted very much
to sit next to her father, but she was little woman
enough not to tease when she knew there were
others to be considered. Mother Blossom had
explained to the children that this ride was
really to give pleasure to Miss Florence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Mrs. Jordan and Paul, who seldom enjoyed an
automobile trip.</p>

<p>“Tuck Dot away in there with you, Mother,”
said Father Blossom, lifting that small girl in,
“and I’ll take the boys with me. Then coming
home, Dot may changes places with Twaddles,
if she likes.”</p>

<p>Finally everyone was nicely packed in and
away they went, leaving Sam and Norah to talk
over the dinner and eat their own and wash the
dishes and put them away.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to feed Philip and Annabel
Lee,” cried Meg, and Sam shouted back that he
would see to “Fill-Up.” This was Sam’s name
for the dog and although Meg did not like it
she was used to it by this time.</p>

<p>“Did you bring anything to eat, Dot?” asked
Bobby, mischievously, twisting in his seat to
speak to his small sister. Dot was almost buried
under the wraps and blankets in the tonneau.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” she said indignantly. “I
meant to bring my turkey, but he’s stuck to my
serge dress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Daddy!” cried Twaddles suddenly. “Oh,
Daddy, I dropped Bobby’s knife!”</p>

<p>Twaddles never went out in the car that he
didn’t drop something. His family were used
to his habit and sometimes Father Blossom
stopped the car and sometimes he didn’t. It
depended on what Twaddles dropped. This
time Father Blossom knew he could not have
dropped anything in the road because he was
safely tucked in between Bobby and himself.</p>

<p>“Daddy, make Twaddles leave my knife
alone!” said Bobby. “He never even asks me if
he can have it and he’s always losing it. It’s my
knife.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get down and pick it up for you,” offered
Twaddles generously.</p>

<p>“You leave it alone!” cried Bobby furiously.
“I’ll get it myself, and if you ever touch it
again——” Bobby didn’t say what would happen,
but from the frown on his face Twaddles
was left to guess that it would be mighty serious.</p>

<p>However, Twaddles had a will of his own
and he began to wriggle, intending to slip down
to the floor and recover the knife. Bobby flung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
his arm around him to hold him and then, as
Twaddles kicked, Bobby began to kick, too.</p>

<p>“Children!” said Mother Blossom in warning,
but she was too late.</p>

<p>Father Blossom stopped the car.</p>

<p>“Meg and Dot, change places with Bobby
and Twaddles,” he said very quietly. “Hurry,
please, and don’t keep us waiting.”</p>

<p>Sam Layton often threatened to make them
change places when they argued, but this was
the first time it had ever really happened to
them. Poor Bobby and Twaddles got slowly
down and Meg and Dot crawled out and up on
the front seat with Father Blossom. Then,
when the robes and blankets were all fixed
again, they drove on. Bobby and Twaddles
were very quiet for half an hour and Meg and
Dot did not talk much, either. Father and
Mother Blossom and the guests had the conversation
all to themselves.</p>

<p>“Ralph!” said Mother Blossom, when they
had driven several miles, “Ralph, I do believe
it is beginning to snow.”</p>

<p>“I thought so myself a few minutes ago,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
answered Father Blossom. “I’ll go on to the
next cross-roads and turn. We can be home
before it storms heavily.”</p>

<p>But the white flakes began to come faster and
faster and the road was white when they reached
the cross-road. Father Blossom turned the car
and they started back to Oak Hill. Dot was
half asleep, though she would have been much
aggrieved if anyone had said so, when Meg said
excitedly that she saw something in the road.</p>

<p>“Look, Daddy, over under that bush!” she
insisted. “Let me get out and see. Oh, maybe
it’s lost in this snowstorm!”</p>

<p>“Let Bobby go, Daughter,” said Father
Blossom stopping the car. “Bobby, don’t you
want to run over and see what that is under the
bush?”</p>

<p>Bobby was very glad to go and he was out in
a minute and running across the road.</p>

<p>“It’s a dog, Daddy,” he shouted. “A little
white dog. And he is so cold!”</p>

<p>“Bring him here and we’ll take care of him,”
said Father Blossom, smiling at Meg who was
nearly jumping up and down with anxiety.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
“Trust Meg to see an animal in trouble. I
never should have noticed that bit of fluff under
the bush. Why, he’s almost the color of the
snow!”</p>

<p>The little white dog Bobby brought back in
his arms was so tiny and so soft and silky that
he might easily have been overlooked in a snowstorm.
He was evidently lost and had crawled
under the bush in an effort to keep warm. Meg
held him on her lap and put her muff over him
to keep the cold air off.</p>

<p>“He has a silver collar on,” she reported, “but
I can’t read it. Can you, Bobby?”</p>

<p>Bobby leaned over the back of the seat and
looked at the collar.</p>

<p>“M-A-T-S-I-E,” he spelled out slowly.
“What a funny name. But there’s some more—C-L-I-F-T-O-N
P-A-R-K.”</p>

<p>“Why, Clifton Park is thirty miles from here,”
said Father Blossom in surprise. “The poor
dog never could have come that distance. I
wonder——”</p>

<p>Before he could say what he wondered, a
handsome shining limousine, coming down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
road slowly from the other direction, stopped.
The chauffeur held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of a dog?” he asked
anxiously. “A little white dog, with a silver
collar?”</p>

<p>And maybe that chauffeur wasn’t surprised
when four children shouted at him, “Is the dog’s
name ‘Matsie’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we found such a dog,” said Father
Blossom, smiling. “Back about forty rods,
under a bush. He was pretty cold, but he seems
to be all right.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur came over and took the dog
Meg held out to him.</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you,” he said awkwardly.
“It would cost me my job if I went
home and told ’em I’d lost Matsie; that dog’s
worth a thousand dollars and took first prize at
the last dog show. Mrs. Hemming thinks a
heap of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is easy to lose a small animal like
that,” said Father Blossom. “Don’t you think
you’d better shut him up in a safe place till you
get home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“You bet I will,” grinned the chauffeur. “I
guess Matsie dropped out when I went into a
rut back there; the rest of the trip he rides down
under the seat tied fast.”</p>

<p>He thanked the Blossoms again for finding
the dog for him and went back to his car, and
Father Blossom continued the journey toward
home. Twaddles, who had been remarkably
silent the whole trip, spoke just as they were
coming into Oak Hill.</p>

<p>“Well, I never dropped a dog out of the car,
did I?” he said seriously, and Mother Blossom
kissed him and said no, he never had.</p>

<p>“But you’ve dropped about everything else,”
declared Bobby gloomily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE FOOTBALL GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FATHER BLOSSOM drove Mrs. Jordan
and Paul home and left Miss Florence at
her house. They all said it had been the happiest
Thanksgiving they had known in years and
the four little Blossoms were happy, too.</p>

<p>“I like to have company come to our house,”
said Meg, as she was going to bed that night.
“Don’t you, Dot?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” replied Dot sleepily. “I’m
thankful for company.”</p>

<p>The next day there was no school, of course,
and though Bobby had planned to play with
Meg and the twins, two boys came to ask him
to play football before he was through breakfast.</p>

<p>“Fred Baldwin has a football, Mother,” said
Bobby earnestly. “And we’re getting up a football<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
team. Do you care if I go over to his house
and play?”</p>

<p>“Let me be on the team?” begged Twaddles.
“I can play football, Bobby. Can’t I, Dot?”</p>

<p>“You’re too little,” answered Bobby impatiently.
“Fred is waiting to know if I can come,
Mother.”</p>

<p>“But, dear, I don’t see where you are going to
play,” protested Mother Blossom. “You can’t
play on the school field, because the older boys
have that for their use.”</p>

<p>“They’re all through playing football now,”
explained Bobby. “The last game was Thanksgiving.
There’s a vacant lot back of Fred’s
house, Mother, and we can play there. I’m the
captain.”</p>

<p>“All right, dear, run along and have a good
time,” said Mother Blossom, giving him a kiss.
“Be sure you come home at twelve o’clock.
And, Twaddles, I’ll think of something nice for
you to do at home. When you are as old as
Bobby, you may play football, too.”</p>

<p>Fred Baldwin and Palmer Davis, two boys in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Bobby’s class at school, were waiting for him.
Fred had his football under his arm.</p>

<p>“We’re going over to Bertrand Ashe’s,” Fred
explained. “His cousin is visiting him over
Thanksgiving and his brother is captain of the
football team at the State University. So he
ought to be a good player.”</p>

<p>Bobby thought a boy who was fortunate
enough to have a brother captain of a University
team ought to be a good player, too, and he
did not wonder that Fred had decided to play in
Bertrand’s yard.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Bertrand, when he saw the
three boys. “This is my cousin, Elmer Lambert.”</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Elmer, a tall thin boy with a
freckled face and nice, merry blue eyes. “I see
you have a football.”</p>

<p>Fred was proud of his football. It was a
present from his grandfather, he explained.
In five minutes the boys were lined up ready for
a game. Of course they knew a real football
team needs eleven players, but as Bertrand sensibly
said there wasn’t room for eleven in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
yard anyway and they could get alone with five.</p>

<p>But from the start the game didn’t go
smoothly. Bobby kicked the ball over the fence
and then, when he had climbed after it and
brought it back, Fred kicked it over the fence
on the other side.</p>

<p>“There isn’t room enough here,” complained
Elmer. “Can’t we play somewhere else, Bertrand?”</p>

<p>“Back of the carpenter shop, across the
street,” suggested Bertrand. “The shop’s built
on the edge of the street and there’s an open
place in back. Come on, I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>The snowstorm which had begun so briskly
the afternoon before when the four little Blossoms
were out automobiling had not amounted
to much after all. It had melted during the
night and though there was a sharp wind and it
was cold, the ground was almost bare.</p>

<p>The carpenter shop “on the edge of the street,”
was a one-story building on the street end of a
long, narrow lot that stretched through to the
next block. There was no one around when the
boys went around back of the shop and it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
to be locked up securely. Bertrand said he
thought the man who owned the shop had gone
away to spend Thanksgiving with his son in
another town.</p>

<p>“Will he mind if we play here?” asked Elmer.</p>

<p>“He won’t care a bit,” replied Bertrand confidently.
“We won’t hurt anything, and besides
he won’t know about it.”</p>

<p>Which wasn’t a very good argument and
would have made Father Blossom laugh if he
had heard it. But the boys were too eager to
resume their game to pay much attention to
anything Bertrand said.</p>

<p>Bobby, as captain, had his “signals” written
down on a piece of paper and he first explained
them to his players and then called off the numbers
as he had seen the high school captain do.
And when they had tried all the signals three
times, Elmer suggested that they practice punting.</p>

<p>“That’s very important,” he explained, “and
my brother says if you can develop a good
punter on your team, half your troubles are
settled. I think Bobby does pretty well now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Bobby was very much pleased at this praise
from a boy whose brother was a big football
captain and he resolved, more firmly than ever,
to make the football team the first year he was
in high school.</p>

<p>“Punt now,” urged Elmer. “Stand back, fellows,
and give him a chance. Go on and try,
Bobby.”</p>

<p>Bobby took the ball from Fred, held it a
moment in his hands and dropped it. Before
it reached the ground he kicked and his toe sent
it curving in a long line over the lot toward the
carpenter shop.</p>

<p>“My goodness, it went in the window!”
gasped Palmer Davis. “Bobby, you’ve kicked it
into the carpenter shop!”</p>

<p>“How’ll we get it out?” asked Fred anxiously.
“All the doors are locked, the back one, too. I
saw the padlocks. How’ll we get my ball back?”</p>

<p>The five boys looked at each other anxiously.
There was Fred’s new, expensive football inside
the locked shop. What would the carpenter say
when he found it there and would he give it
back?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Do you know the man who owns the shop,
Bertrand?” asked Elmer sensibly. “Is he
cross?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is,” said Bertrand quickly. “He’ll
be mad anyway ’cause we’ve been playing here
and I don’t believe he’ll give the ball back. He
doesn’t like boys much, ever since a gang used
to play round his shop and steal pieces of wood
and tin and solder. That’s why he had the locks
put on the doors; he used to have just bolts.”</p>

<p>Bertrand had a memory like a great many
other people. He remembered these small details
after something had happened.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t break a window,” said Bobby
hopefully. “The ball went through that little
window that was left open; ’tisn’t as if I had
broken a window in his shop.”</p>

<p>“That won’t make any difference,” said Bertrand
gloomily. “I tell you he will be mad
’cause we played on his lot. I think we’d better
go home before he comes and finds us here.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go without my ball,” protested
Fred. “It’s brand-new and I want it. Bobby,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
you have to ask the man for it, ’cause you kicked
it through the window.”</p>

<p>As they talked the boys had been walking
slowly toward the carpenter shop, and now they
stood directly under the open window. It was
smaller than the three regular-sized windows
which were closed—and presumably locked.
Bobby could reach the sill of the small window
with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>“I’m going in to get it,” he said quietly to
Fred. “You watch, and if you see the man
coming sing out.”</p>

<p>“Are you going in?” asked Fred, surprised.
“Maybe you can’t get out. Aren’t you afraid,
Bobby?”</p>

<p>Bobby considered. He was a very honest
little boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid, kind of,” he said truthfully.
“But I’d be more afraid to go and ask the man
for it. Be sure you yell if you see him coming.”</p>

<p>He scrambled up to the window sill and the
boys helped push him through the small opening.
They heard him drop down to the floor
and begin rummaging around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“I don’t see where it went,” he cried. “Gee,
there’s a lot of things in here.”</p>

<p>“Come on, I’m going in!” exclaimed Elmer.
“It’s mean to make Bobby do it all. We were
all playing. I’m going to help him find the
ball.”</p>

<p>The rest of the boys followed Elmer’s lead.
One by one they scrambled up to the little window
and squeezed through. Once inside, they
found the shop so fascinating that they had to
stop and look around before they began to search
for the missing ball.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose this is?” cried Fred,
pointing to a queer tool that lay on the workbench.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—don’t touch anything,” said
Bobby. “I wish I could see the ball. Oh, here’s
a cat!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, a sleek gray and white cat lay
curled up on a coat in one corner of the room.
She opened her eyes sleepily and stared at
Bobby and when he patted her she purred
gently.</p>

<p>“Here’s the ball!” shouted Elmer Lambert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
“Look, it rolled under this basket. Pitch it out
of the window, Fred, and then we’ll go.”</p>

<p>“But I want to see how this works,” said Fred,
who was examining a box that clamped to a
block of steel. “Just wait a minute, can’t you?
I want to see if I can work it.”</p>

<p>“All right, you wait and the carpenter man
will come along and catch us,” Bobby told him.
“Then I guess you’ll be sorry.”</p>

<p>The mention of the carpenter was enough for
Fred. He tossed his precious football out of
the window and climbed after it, hastily followed
by the other boys. All breathed a sigh of
relief as they landed safely on the ground.</p>

<p>“H. Bennett,” read Bobby, looking up at the
sign which hung over the door. “Does Mr. H.
Bennett own the shop, Bertrand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s the carpenter,” replied Bertrand,
“and he has men who go out and work for him.
He lives up near the school.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know that man,” said Palmer.</p>

<p>Bobby thought it must be nearly twelve
o’clock and when Bertrand ran into his house
to look at the clock, he called back to the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
that it was quarter of twelve. So they scattered
to go home for lunch and there was of course
no more football game.</p>

<p>Luncheon was ready when Bobby reached
home and oddly enough he did not speak of the
morning’s experience. Mother Blossom asked
him if the boys had played football, and Bobby
answered yes, but he did not say anything about
the game. Usually he liked to tell about his
fun and the twins depended on their older
brother to give them new ideas for playing.</p>

<p>“Sam says he’s going over to Clayton, and
he’ll come home by the foundry and get Daddy
and if you say so we may go with him,” cried
Meg, running in from the garage where she had
taken Annabel Lee and Philip their dinners.
“Please, Mother, you want us to go, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, let us!” cried the twins.</p>

<p>“I suppose as it is holiday time and you may
not have the opportunity again soon, you’ll have
to go,” said Mother Blossom. “Be sure you
wear your sweaters under your coats, and don’t
bother Sam with too many questions and too
much chatter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Oh, goody!” cried the twins, and the children
all clattered out of the room to prepare for
their trip.</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms had their drive to
Clayton and came home with Father Blossom
just in time for dinner. The long ride in the
cold air made them sleepy and they were glad
to go to bed earlier than usual.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, when it was dark
and still and very cold, something woke Bobby.
He sat up in bed and listened, then snuggled
down under the blankets, for a chilly wind blew
in at the window.</p>

<p>“Fire engines,” he whispered, and went to
sleep again.</p>

<small>BOBBY HEARS BAD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“ANOTHER cup of coffee, please, Norah,”
said Father Blossom.</p>

<p>It was breakfast time, and the four little
Blossoms had each made a separate trip to the
door and back, before taking seats at the table,
to see if it “wasn’t going to snow.” Father
Blossom had finally said that no one was to open
the door again and that he would like to eat
breakfast once with his family when he did not
feel that he had to hurry.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going directly to the foundry,
then?” asked Mother Blossom, sugaring Dot’s
oatmeal for her.</p>

<p>“No, I have an errand in town first,” replied
Father Blossom. “By the way, Sam tells me a
carpenter shop burned down last night.”</p>

<p>“Mr. H. Bennett’s carpenter shop?” asked
Bobby in surprise. Then he flushed a bright
red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Why, yes, it was Bennett’s,” said Father
Blossom, glancing curiously at Bobby. “What
do you know about the place, Son?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” muttered Bobby. “It’s
over by Bertrand’s house.”</p>

<p>“Was it much of a loss, dear?” asked Mother
Blossom.</p>

<p>“I believe it was,” replied Father Blossom,
and Bobby listened eagerly. “Several hundred
dollars’ worth of valuable tools and some building
plans and considerable cabinet work was
destroyed, Sam says. The only thing saved was
a cat.”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Bobby’s tongue to add,
“a gray and white one,” but he stopped himself
just in time.</p>

<p>“There’s Fred Baldwin whistling for me,”
he said instead. “He wants me to come and
play. May I be excused, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Mother, Bobby never plays with us any
more,” complained Twaddles. “He ought to
stay in our yard some, don’t you think? All he
cares about now is playing football.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind the football,” said Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Blossom smiling. “But I do wish the boys
wouldn’t come and whistle outside the house
when we are eating, Bobby. I like you to stay
at the table till a meal is properly finished.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will next time,” promised Bobby,
throwing his arms about her and giving her a
hug.</p>

<p>The twins took the opportunity to help themselves
to marmalade and when the scandalized
Norah and Meg drew attention to the mountain
of sweet stuff on the two plates, Bobby ran off
while Twaddles and Dot were loudly protesting
that they had only taken a “tiny bit.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Bobby!” said Fred, as Bobby came
running down the path. “Say, did you know the
carpenter shop burned down last night?”</p>

<p>“Daddy told me,” replied Bobby. “I thought
I heard fire engines when I woke up. It’s lucky
they saved the cat.”</p>

<p>The boys were walking up the street and now
Fred turned and looked at Bobby.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bennett thinks we set it on fire,” he said
in a low tone, and glancing over his shoulder as
though he expected to see the owner of the carpenter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
shop behind him. “He heard we were in
his shop yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we were—we didn’t set it on
fire!” said Bobby crossly. He was cross because
he was worried. It is not very pleasant to be
told that someone suspects you of setting his
shop on fire.</p>

<p>“No, of course we didn’t,” agreed Fred.
“But you know Bertrand says Mr. Bennett
doesn’t like boys, and I suppose if he had caught
us in there he would have been awfully mad.
And now he knows we were in there, he’s sure
we did it.”</p>

<p>“Who told him we were in his shop?” asked
Bobby suddenly.</p>

<p>“Bertrand says some of the neighbors saw us
climb in,” explained Fred. “Bertrand’s over at
my house now, waiting for us. He told me.
And Palmer Davis is there, too, and Elmer
Lambert.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Fred found the other three boys
in Fred’s yard. They looked serious and no
one suggested football. Evidently Bertrand
had been telling them more about Mr. Bennett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“He’s so mad,” reported Bertrand when he
saw Fred and Bobby, “he’s so mad, I don’t dare
go on that side of the street. I saw it burning
last night—everybody on our street woke up
when the engines came. And a solid mahogany
china closet he was carving was burned, and my
father says he never had any insurance.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t burn his shop,” argued Bobby.
“Look how long ago we were in there—yesterday
morning and it never burned down till late
at night. Doesn’t that show we didn’t do it?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Bennett says maybe we tipped
over oil or varnish or something and it took a
long time to soak into the wood and then it
caught fire from the stove he had in the corner,”
explained Bertrand.</p>

<p>“Did he tell you that?” demanded Bobby.</p>

<p>“Oh, my no!” said Bertrand, looking frightened
at the idea. “He never said a word to me;
I wouldn’t go near him. But the man that tends
our furnace heard him and he told me. And he
says Mr. Bennett has all our names and he is
going to see our fathers!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>The boys stared at each other. This was
dreadful! Only Elmer Lambert smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m going home this afternoon,” he said.
“Gee, I’m sorry for the rest of you.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell my father right away!”
cried Bobby. “I’ll go out to the foundry before
he comes home to lunch. He comes home at
noon, Saturdays.”</p>

<p>But Fred Baldwin sprang up angrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare!” he said excitedly, shaking
his fist at Bobby. “Don’t you dare tell your
father! He’d call up my father and then I’d
catch it. My father will be mad if he hears I
went into the old carpenter shop when the door
was locked. That was all your fault, Bobby—we
wouldn’t have gone in if you hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, he went after your ball,” said Elmer
reasonably. “And I guess your father will know
you were in the shop if Mr. Bennett tells him
about it, won’t he?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he won’t tell him,” said the hopeful
Fred. “He may forget all about it, or find out
who really did set the shop on fire. But anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
who tells first is mean, because my father
will scold like anything.”</p>

<p>So Bobby promised not to tell his father and
the other boys promised to keep silent, too.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in making trouble,” declared
Fred when the noon whistles blew and his
friends started for their homes. “Perhaps Mr.
Bennett won’t say a thing, and then think how
silly we’d feel.”</p>

<p>But Bobby, while he may not have felt silly,
certainly was feeling far from comfortable as
he walked home. And when he reached home
and saw the car in the garage, which meant that
Father Blossom was home earlier than usual, he
wished that it was not Saturday. If it had been,
say, Tuesday, his father would not have come
home to lunch.</p>

<p>“Now, Bobby, I want you to stay in the house
this afternoon and play,” said Mother Blossom
cheerfully. “You haven’t been in the house
hardly an hour since the holiday began. You
and Meg think of something you want to do,
and if Dot and Twaddles can play it, too, that
will be lovely. Your father and I are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
over accounts and we want to have a few hours
of quiet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, he isn’t even going anywhere,”
thought poor Bobby, toiling upstairs after Meg
and the noisy twins who were headed for the
playroom. He had been hoping, during lunch,
that Father Blossom would go for a drive in
the car and perhaps take Mother Blossom with
him.</p>

<p>“What ails you, Bobby?” asked Meg when
they reached the third floor front room, given
over to the four little Blossoms as a winter place
to play. “I’ve asked you twice what you want
to do and you don’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“There’s the doorbell,” said Bobby, running
into the hall to look over the banisters. It was
only the laundryman and he came back, relieved.</p>

<p>“Mother says it isn’t nice to hang over the
railing when the bell rings,” said Meg reprovingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care, I will if I want to,” was Bobby’s
answer to this. “What shall we play?”</p>

<p>“Soap bubbles,” suggested Dot, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
seemed to suit everyone, so Meg brought out
the bowls and the pipes and an apron for Dot
who was sure to need one.</p>

<p>The bell rang three times while Bobby was
blowing soap bubbles and each time his heart
gave a fearful thump. He was afraid Mr. Bennett
had come to complain about the carpenter
shop. But none of the rings brought him, and
Bobby was beginning to think the carpenter was
not coming that afternoon when suddenly he
heard Norah calling him from the second floor
hall.</p>

<p>“Bobby!” she called. “Bobby, your father
wants you right away.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear the doorbell,” said Bobby to
himself as he walked slowly downstairs. “How
could he come ’thout ringing the bell?”</p>

<p>Bobby never doubted that Mr. Bennett had
come. And he had. He had come in his small
work car and Father Blossom had seen him
through the window and had gone to the door
to save him waiting in the cold. That was why
Bobby had not heard the doorbell.</p>

<p>Although he walked as slowly as he could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Bobby finally came to the door of the living-room.
There was no one there for Mother
Blossom, supposing that Mr. Bennett had come
to talk business with Father Blossom, had excused
herself and gone upstairs to write a letter.</p>

<p>“In here, Son,” said Father Blossom’s voice,
and Bobby saw they were in the little back room
where Father Blossom had his desk.</p>

<p>Mr. Bennett sat facing the door and Father
Blossom sat at his desk. The carpenter was a
short, heavy man with a red face and a deep,
hoarse voice. He had small, quick blue eyes
and just now they looked angry.</p>

<p>“Bobby,” said Father Blossom quietly, “this
is Mr. Bennett whose shop burned down last
night. And he seems to think that you, and
some other boys, are responsible for the fire.”</p>

<p>“Think!” snorted Mr. Bennett. “Think! I
don’t think anything about it; I know those kids
set the place on fire. And they’ve got to pay
for it.”</p>

<p>Bobby had got as far as the desk and there he
stood, feeling very unhappy and a little
ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Were you in the shop at all, Bobby?” asked
Father Blossom keenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy,” replied Bobby bravely, raising
his eyes. “I went in after the football. The
window was open. And I didn’t touch a thing.
None of us did. Except the cat. We stroked
her and made her purr.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell me that five boys—and I
have the names of everyone of you—could go
in a tool shop and not upset things,” scolded
Mr. Bennett. “I know as well as though I’d
seen you do it, some of you kicked over turpentine
and varnish and laid the foundations for
the fire.”</p>

<p>“We did not!” retorted Bobby. “I had to get
the ball out, ’cause it wasn’t mine. But I didn’t
set your old shop——”</p>

<p>“That will do, Son,” interrupted Father
Blossom. “You had absolutely no right to go
into Mr. Bennett’s shop in his absence and I
am exceedingly sorry to hear you did such a
thing. The other boys were wrong, too, and
Mr. Bennett has a right to be angry. I don’t
think you are responsible for the fire, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and we hope we’ll be able to convince Mr.
Bennett presently.”</p>

<p>“Convince me!” almost shouted the carpenter.
“Why, I tell you those boys set my shop
on fire! A parcel of young ones, skylarking
over my workbench and in among my tools and
varnishes—I wish I’d caught ’em at it! I could
make ’em dance! And now that boy stands
there and denies up and down he had anything
to do with the fire and you expect me to believe
him. I’m going up to the police court and get
warrants out for every one of ’em, that’s what
I’m going to do!” shrieked the angry carpenter,
thumping the desk.</p>

<p>Bobby turned pale and his knees began to
wobble. But Father Blossom only shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will do that, Mr. Bennett,”
he said.</p>

<small>THE MAGIC FOUNTAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FATHER BLOSSOM did not seem to be
afraid of Mr. Bennett, though the carpenter’s
red face and angry eyes and the way
he pounded the desk scared Bobby speechless.
Father Blossom continued to sit quietly in his
chair and when Mr. Bennett started toward the
door, repeating that he was going uptown and
“get warrants,” Father Blossom merely said
again, “I don’t think you will do that, Mr.
Bennett.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” blustered the carpenter, stopping
half-way in the hall. “Why not? What’s to
stop me, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place,” said Father
Blossom evenly, “the recorder isn’t likely to take
a complaint against boys seriously; and if he
did, he would require more evidence than you
seem to have. For instance, are you sure your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
cat didn’t upset this varnish and oil you
speak of?”</p>

<p>“The cat!” sputtered Mr. Bennett. “It’s
likely a cat would do that, isn’t it? I never
heard such nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t see the cat do it, of course,” admitted
Father Blossom. “But neither did you
see the boys. You only surmise. And a police
complaint needs evidence to back it, Mr.
Bennett.”</p>

<p>The carpenter scolded and raged another ten
minutes, but in the end he went away muttering
that he guessed he’d wait a few days before
having the boys arrested. When the front door
banged behind him, Bobby breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“Now I want to know all about this affair,”
said Father Blossom gravely, and Bobby told
him.</p>

<p>“We didn’t set the shop on fire, honestly we
didn’t, Daddy,” he concluded. “We didn’t
knock over anything. And I only touched the
cat.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe you set the place on fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
either,” said Father Blossom. “But remember
after this, Bobby, that it is never right to go into
a room or a shop or building that belongs to
someone else when it is locked expressly to keep
people out. You should have left the ball
there and asked for it back when you could find
Mr. Bennett. But then, boys don’t think of that
when they are playing and I won’t blame you
too severely for crawling through the window.
But you made another mistake and one I think
you must have known when you made it.”</p>

<p>Bobby looked at the floor. “I—I didn’t say
anything ’bout the fire,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“You didn’t come straight to me when you
heard Mr. Bennett was angry and accused you,”
said Father Blossom. “It makes me feel bad
to learn that my boy was afraid to tell me he
was in trouble.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Bobby and he flung
himself into his father’s lap and cried a little,
even if he was seven and a half years old.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you, Daddy,” he insisted.
“Honestly I did. But—but—the fellows——”</p>

<p>“Someone didn’t want to tell, I suppose,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Father Blossom. “Well, we don’t like to go
against our friends’ wishes and sometimes they
say we will get them into trouble if we do. But
I think it is always best for a boy to tell his
daddy, at least of his own share in anything like
this. Next time you’ll know better what to do.”</p>

<p>Bobby was silent for a little while and then
he asked timidly if the carpenter could have
them arrested.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Son, but I doubt it,” replied
Father Blossom, who never pretended to know
when he was not sure. “You want to say as little
about this as possible and don’t talk unkindly of
Mr. Bennett with the other boys. You were not
wholly in the right, you know, and he has lost a
valuable collection of tools and much fine work.
It is natural that he should feel bitter. If you
are patient, some day he will find out that he
has been mistaken and I know he is man enough
to admit it when he discovers he is wrong.”</p>

<p>Bobby was very quiet through dinner that
night and he stayed closely to the house over
Sunday. He did not tell even Meg about Mr.
Bennett, though usually he told her everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
that happened to him. Mother Blossom knew,
of course, but she did not speak of it. It was not
till Meg went to school Monday morning that
she heard of the mischief the five boys were supposed
to have done.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bobby!” she gasped when she met him
at the school gate at noon. “Bobby, do you
know what that awful Charlie Black is saying
about you? He says you and Fred Baldwin and
Palmer Davis and Bertrand Ashe and that
Lambert boy who was visiting Bertrand over
Thanksgiving, set fire to Mr. Bennett’s carpenter
shop!”</p>

<p>“Charlie Black is a fibber!” said Bobby hotly.
“We didn’t set fire to the shop.” And then, because
there was no hope of satisfying Meg with
anything less, he told her the whole story.</p>

<p>She was as indignant as any small sister would
be and she assured Bobby that she knew he had
not burned down the shop. But not everyone
had so much faith, and as the news travelled
through the school—as such news will—Bobby
and the three other boys (Elmer Lambert had
gone home Saturday afternoon and was safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
out of trouble) had to submit to much teasing
and questioning. Charlie Black and Tim Roon
taunted Bobby openly with having set fire to the
carpenter shop, and one recess a pitched battle
started between Bobby and his friends and
Charlie Black and Tim Roon and their chums.</p>

<p>Fighting was strictly forbidden in the school
yard and the culprits were marched in disgrace
to the principal’s office by one of the teachers
who said that it was “a mercy Mr. Carter is
here today and can punish you as you deserve.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter asked a few questions, scolded
them all for breaking the rule against fighting
and then sent Tim and Charlie and their three
followers down to the gymnasium to wash off
the dirt, first warning them that they were not
to molest Bobby or his chums or make any reference
whatever to the carpenter shop fire again.</p>

<p>Then the principal kept Bobby and Fred
Palmer and Bertrand a few minutes longer
while he told them that he did not believe they
were responsible for the fire and that he thought
very few people would ever believe it. But,
he said, it was foolish to pay any attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
taunts or teasing, and that when people were
wrongly accused, if they were brave, it didn’t
matter to them what unkind things were said
about them.</p>

<p>“And now you may go,” said Mr. Carter
smiling. “But there must be no more fighting.
Another time I shall have to be more severe.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t even know he’d heard about the
fire,” said Bobby, walking home that noon with
Meg. “I guess everybody in Oak Hill knows
about it; and Mr. Bennett probably goes around
telling everyone we set fire to his shop. Oh,
dear, I wish I’d never played football!”</p>

<p>But Bobby forgot his troubles when he and
Meg reached home and found that Dot and
Twaddles were planning to give a play that
afternoon.</p>

<p>“You must hurry right home from school,”
announced Dot importantly. “Mother is coming
and so is Norah. The curtain raises at
three.”</p>

<p>“You talk as if the curtain were Norah’s
bread,” giggled Meg. “You should say the
curtain ‘rises’ at three, Dot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Huh, it doesn’t rise, either,” remarked
Twaddles, who had come to the lunch table
with his face streaked with dust. “It pulls
apart!”</p>

<p>“How dirty your face is,” observed Bobby,
big-brother fashion. “Where are you going
to give this play, Twaddles?”</p>

<p>“Up garret,” answered Twaddles. “You pay
six pins and you can come. And we have seats
and everything.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it,” laughed
Mother Blossom when Bobby asked her what
kind of a play the young ones were planning.
“Dot and Twaddles have done it all themselves;
they have been working all morning and aside
from considerable racket, I wouldn’t know
there was to be a play. You and Meg will have
to wait and see. And, Twaddles, my dear little
son, how could you come to the table with such
a dirty face?”</p>

<p>“That’s shadows,” said Twaddles comfortably.
“Will you hurry, Meg?”</p>

<p>Meg and Bobby promised to hurry home
from school that afternoon and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
home twenty minutes after the dismissal bell
had sounded. They paid their six pins to Twaddles,
who stood at the door of the garret, and
went in. Mother Blossom and Norah were already
there, seated on a board placed on two
small footstools.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t a very high seat,” whispered Norah
to Meg, who sat down beside her, “but then you
haven’t far to fall.”</p>

<p>Meg and Bobby stared in surprise at the corner
of the attic which the twins had curtained
off for the stage. They would not let anybody
help, so they had not been able to hang their
curtains very high. A string had been stretched
from one side of the wall to the other, where the
garret roof began to slope, and two old lace curtains
were flung over this. The audience could
see through the lace without the slightest trouble
but, as Dot said, they were supposed to pretend
they couldn’t.</p>

<p>“The play will begin in a minute,” announced
Twaddles, stepping out from behind the curtain.
“It is called ‘The Magic Fountain’ and I invented
some of it and Dot did, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>The audience politely clapped, and Twaddles
reached up to pull the curtains apart. Something
went wrong, the string broke and curtains
and cord came down upon the unfortunate
stage manager. Bobby untangled him and
Twaddles said he thought they could get along
without curtains.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Dot,” he called in a loud whisper.
“Come on, and begin. What are you
waiting for?”</p>

<p>“I got it!” cried Dot, climbing out of a trunk
that stood open on the “stage.” She wore a
blue silk dress that had been her grandmother’s
and was the pride of her heart because it had
a long train.</p>

<p>“This is the fountain,” declared Twaddles,
pointing to the open trunk. “I am a witch-man
and I point my wand at it and a beautiful
princess comes out. You watch.”</p>

<p>The summer before, Twaddles and Dot had
seen an electric fountain and had watched fascinated
while pretty girls and beautiful scenery
and once what Dot called a “whole house” had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
risen apparently out of the water. This had
given them the idea for their play.</p>

<p>“You have to wait a minute while I put on
my hair,” said Dot so seriously that the audience
did not dare laugh.</p>

<p>The desire of Dot for long golden curls was
something no one could understand. All her
dolls had to have yellow hair and she was always
sighing for long, springy curls instead of
the short, thick dark hair that covered her head.
Now she carefully put on a circlet of pasteboard
to which she had pinned long streamers of yellow
crepe paper twisted to look something like
curls.</p>

<p>“You look crazy,” said Bobby frankly, but
Twaddles withered him with a look.</p>

<p>“A heap you know about a princess,” he said
scornfully. “They always have long hair. Go
on, Dot.”</p>

<p>Dot curled herself into the trunk and Twaddles
stood by it. He rapped with his wand
three times and up rose the princess, slowly and
gracefully, her yellow curls dangling half-way
to her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Now go back!” commanded the witch-man,
striking the trunk with his wand again to make
the princess disappear.</p>

<p>She disappeared, but more quickly than she
had intended. Twaddles’ stick had jarred the
heavy lid of the trunk and it crashed down, hiding
the princess from view, but not shutting out
her shrieks of fright.</p>

<p>“Mother!” screamed poor Dot. “Mother!
Ow! Open it, Twaddles!”</p>

<p>“You’re a fine witch-man,” scolded Bobby,
rushing for the trunk; but Mother Blossom and
Norah reached it first.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WELL, Dot wasn’t hurt, and Mother had
her out of the trunk in a jiffy. Dot,
between her sobs, managed to remember that it
was the end of the play, anyway, and that made
her feel better. And after Twaddles had explained
that he did not mean to knock so hard,
they all went downstairs.</p>

<p>“I think it was worth six pins,” said Bobby
slowly, and Mother Blossom laughed and said
she thought so, too.</p>

<p>For the first time in weeks the twins did not
envy Bobby and Meg when they started off to
school the next morning. It had snowed during
the night, and great was the excitement of the
four little Blossoms who awoke to find a beautiful
white world.</p>

<p>“We can play in it, can’t we?” urged Twaddles,
bouncing around in his chair and nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
upsetting Meg’s oatmeal bowl. “Let’s hurry
and go out, Dot.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we don’t have to go to school,” said
Dot. “Meg has to go; she can’t play in the
snow till this afternoon. And Bobby has to go
to school—he can’t play, either.”</p>

<p>“I hate school!” muttered Bobby. “I wish I
never had to go near the place.”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom glanced at him in surprise
and Father Blossom put down his paper and
said if they’d hurry he would take him and Meg
to school in the car. Mr. Bennett’s story of the
fire was known all over Oak Hill by this time
and though his parents guessed that Bobby was
not exactly happy under such an accusation,
they did not know how much tormenting he had
to endure. Mr. Carter managed to keep him
and the other boys out of actual fights, but he
could not prevent the sly teasing that went on.
The lads in the upper grades took special delight
in pretending that they heard fire engines
whenever Bobby or any of the three boys accused
with him of the burning of the carpenter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
shop came near them. Bobby often said
gloomily that he would like to run away.</p>

<p>“Well, school closes Friday,” Meg reminded
her brother cheerfully. “And it’s almost Christmas.
I have to go shopping Saturday.”</p>

<p>“So do I, Meg,” chimed in Dot. “I have to
go shopping. Can’t I go with you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, too,” said Twaddles placidly. “I
have ten cents to spend.”</p>

<p>“I want to go by myself,” declared Meg. “I
don’t see why you always have to tag along.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you’d want to go where
you’re not wanted,” said Bobby crossly.</p>

<p>“Well, we do,” retorted Twaddles. “We’re
going—you’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Why, this doesn’t sound much like Christmas,”
said Father Blossom in surprise. “You’ll
be quarreling in a minute, and no one should
ever quarrel at Christmas time. If you’re coming
with me, Meg and Bobby, get your things
on. And, Dot and Twaddles, I thought you
were going to play out in the snow?”</p>

<p>The thought of the snow restored Dot and
Twaddles to good humor and they ran to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
their mittens and leggings and coats, while Meg
and Bobby rode to school with Sam and Father
Blossom.</p>

<p>When they came home at noon, they had news
to tell of the last day, before the Christmas vacation
began.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to have exercises this year,”
reported Meg, “but Miss Wright is going to
read us a Christmas story and everybody will
sing. And then there is a big Christmas tree
and every child brings two presents—not great,
big expensive ones, Mother, but little silly ones.”</p>

<p>“What’s a silly present?” demanded Twaddles.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Meg with dignity, “can’t I
ever speak to you without Twaddles listening?”</p>

<p>“I’m not listening,” cried Twaddles, much
hurt. “And Dot isn’t listening, either.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose Uncle Dave and Aunt
Miranda will think of children who squabble
as you do?” said Mother Blossom. “Bobby,
will you bring me the letter that is on the hall
table, like my good little son?”</p>

<p>“Is Uncle Dave coming?” asked Meg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Yes, dear, he and Aunt Miranda are coming
to spend Christmas with us,” replied Mother
Blossom. “The letter came this morning. They
will get here—let me see, when did uncle write
they would get here?”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom opened the letter Bobby
brought her and ran over the faint, small handwriting
hastily. Uncle Dave was her own uncle,
and great-uncle to the four little Blossoms. He
was an old man and it was not easy for him to
write a letter.</p>

<p>“Uncle Dave writes they will be here Monday,
that is the day before Christmas,” said
Mother Blossom. “I am so glad they can come;
they have never seen Dot and Twaddles, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mother, may Bobby and I go shopping
without coming home from school this
afternoon?” asked Meg. “We have to get two
things apiece, that’s four altogether.”</p>

<p>“Let us go, Mother?” begged Dot. “We can
go and meet Meg and Bobby after school.”</p>

<p>“I think Meg and Bobby should have this
afternoon alone to buy the presents for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
school Christmas tree,” said Mother Blossom
firmly. “Then, Saturday morning, you may all
go shopping together. How will that be?”</p>

<p>This seemed to suit everyone, and Mother
Blossom gave Bobby an extra kiss as he and
Meg hurried back to school. Bobby did not
have much to say about school nowadays, and
Mother Blossom was sorry he did not feel
happier.</p>

<p>“Mother gave me forty cents,” said Meg as
they walked along. “We mustn’t buy anything
that costs more than ten cents, Miss Wright
said.”</p>

<p>“Who do we give ’em to?” asked Bobby curiously.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you hear Miss Wright when she
was talking this morning in assembly?” asked
Meg, surprised. “She said she’ll have a basket
in her office tomorrow, two baskets I mean, one
for boys’ presents and one for the girls. And we
wrap our things up and drop them in, one for a
boy and one for a girl; then Miss Wright puts
the names on and no one knows what the presents
are, not even Miss Wright or Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>As soon as school was out that afternoon
Bobby and Meg started for the stores. It had
stopped snowing soon after noon, and the walks
were wet and slippery. Some of the children
had their sleds out but there was not enough
snow for good sledding or coasting.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to the five-and-ten-cent store,”
planned Meg. “Isn’t it fun to buy four things!”</p>

<p>She and Bobby spent over an hour, looking
at everything on the long counters, and finally
Meg bought a chain of blue beads for a girl
and a little red-covered address book for a boy.
Bobby chose a little pin tray for a girl and for
his boy’s present he selected a key-ring.</p>

<p>The twins were nearly beside themselves with
eagerness to see the presents, and they insisted
on helping tie them up, and Dot wanted to take
them to the school and put them in the baskets
that night.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe in wasting time, do you,
Dot?” teased Father Blossom. “However, I
think tomorrow morning will be better. Meg
says the tree will not be trimmed till Friday.”</p>

<p>The next day was Thursday, and Meg and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Bobby took their tissue-paper wrapped parcels
to school and dropped them into the two large
baskets which stood in the vice-principal’s office.
There was a buzz of excitement in every classroom
and Miss Lee, Bobby’s teacher, said that
school might as well close then and there for
all the work that was being done.</p>

<p>“Tim Roon, if I see you whispering once
more,” Miss Lee scolded, “you will have to
stay after school an hour tomorrow night.
What are you and Charlie Black giggling
over?”</p>

<p>Tim Roon merely stopped whispering, but
did not explain.</p>

<p>“I wish we could go see the tree,” said
Twaddles wistfully Thursday night. “Meg
and Bobby have all the fun.”</p>

<p>“Why, Twaddles!” said Mother Blossom.
“You and Dot are going shopping Saturday
morning, you know you are. And Norah and
I need you tomorrow to help us get ready for
Uncle Dave and Aunt Miranda.”</p>

<p>So Twaddles cheered up and decided that he
was important, after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Friday morning, Meg and Bobby pattered
away to school for the one session which always
featured the last day before the close of a term
or the beginning of a holiday. They found the
building bright with wreaths and ropes of
Christmas greens.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the tree?” asked Palmer
Davis excitedly, meeting Bobby in the hall.
“It’s a great big one, almost as high as the ceiling.
And all the presents are tied on. They did
it last night.”</p>

<p>The pupils filed into the assembly hall as
usual, but it is doubtful whether any of them
heard the Bible reading or knew which song
they were singing. All eyes were fastened on
the beautiful big tree which towered nearly to
the ceiling. It was sprinkled with tissue-paper
packages and looked as mysterious as though
Santa Claus had trimmed it himself.</p>

<p>There was an hour or so of work in the classrooms,
putting the desks in order for the holiday
recess, and making sure that no loose papers
were left in the books, and then the gong
sounded again and the whole four grades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
marched back to the assembly hall for the
exercises.</p>

<p>Bobby’s class sat directly across the aisle from
Meg’s and she saw him and smiled. Miss
Wright read them a Christmas story that made
everyone think of Christmas Eve and stockings
to be filled and all the fun of Christmas morning;
then the school sang two Christmas carols
and then, and <i>then</i> it was time to distribute the
presents. Mr. Carter came in to do that. He
had spent half the morning at the grammar
school exercises.</p>

<p>It was great fun and there was so much talk
and laughter—for Mr. Carter himself said that
they should talk as much as they pleased—that
even the janitor peeped in to see what the racket
was about. The pupils were told to unwrap
their presents as soon as they received them and
such a collection you never saw! There were
tin whistles and small horns, and these, of
course, the boys simply had to test at once, and
ribbons and little dolls and candy and paint
boxes, and indeed about everything you could
hope to mention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Meg had a tiny painting set (which she
planned to give to Dot) and a doll’s fan for her
gifts, and she looked about for Bobby to show
them to him as soon as she had unwrapped
them. She found him in one corner of the room
with Palmer Davis, Bertrand and Fred. Bobby
looked very angry.</p>

<p>“I think it’s mean,” Fred was saying as Meg
came up.</p>

<p>“If I knew who did it,” began Bobby hotly,
but Miss Mason approached him smilingly before
he could finish what he meant to say.</p>

<p>“Let me see what you have, Bobby,” she said
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Bobby put his hands behind his back and
looked obstinate.</p>

<p>“Bobby, I asked you to let me see your Christmas
presents,” said Miss Mason, beginning to
look severe.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t!” blurted Bobby, trying to get
behind Fred Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Bobby Blossom, how dare you speak to me
like that!” exclaimed Miss Mason, losing her
temper, while Meg wished she wouldn’t scold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Bobby in such a loud tone. All the children
were listening. “Mr. Carter, what do you think
of a boy who flatly refuses to obey?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter turned when Miss Mason raised
her voice. He said nothing, but Bobby knew
that he was looking at him. He could not bear
to have the principal think he was stubborn and
he was dreadfully afraid he was going to cry.
He jerked his hand up and threw what he held
directly at the astonished Miss Mason.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a piece of coal!” said Meg aloud.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>COMPANY COMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I ’M VERY sorry this happened,” said Mr.
Carter gravely.</p>

<p>He and Meg and Bobby stood in the hall, just
outside the Assembly hall, where the children
were singing the closing Christmas carol. The
principal had beckoned to Bobby when the
music began and Meg had followed them.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” repeated Mr. Carter. “Do
you know who sent this piece of coal to you,
Bobby?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” said Bobby hastily. “I don’t know
at all.”</p>

<p>“And you evidently don’t want me to guess,”
said the principal with a half-smile. “I think
that will be better, after all. Just pretend to
pay no attention and whoever is trying to tease
you will see that he has missed his aim. Did I
hand this to you from the tree, Bobby? Was
there anything with it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Yes, you gave it to me,” replied Bobby.
“My other present was a game.”</p>

<p>“Was there anything with the piece of coal?”
persisted Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>“There was a piece of paper that said ‘to help
you start another fire,’” said Bobby jerkily. “I
tore it up.”</p>

<p>“I should have liked to see the writing,” remarked
Mr. Carter. “But never mind. Evidently
someone removed one package marked
with your name from the basket last night, after
we finished working, or it may have been this
morning, and substituted the coal. The best
thing to do is to ignore the silly trick altogether.”</p>

<p>The carol ended just as he finished speaking
and the assembly broke up. Mr. Carter put his
arm around Bobby, wished him a Merry Christmas,
and said that he must let nothing spoil his
holidays. Then he shook hands with Meg and
wished her “Merry Christmas,” too, and they
were free to go. As they went slowly upstairs
to get their wraps, for the corridors were
crowded, they passed Miss Mason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Merry Christmas, Bobby!” she smiled and
nodded. “And you, too, Meg.”</p>

<p>That was Miss Mason’s way of telling Bobby
that she understood why he had been cross and
that she knew he did not mean to be rude.
Bobby’s own sunny smile answered her and he
began to feel better directly. By the time he
reached home he had almost forgotten the piece
of coal.</p>

<p>“No more school for two weeks!” he shouted,
prancing into the kitchen where Mother Blossom
and Norah were.</p>

<p>“It’s snowing! It’s snowing!” shrieked the
twins, tumbling up the back steps and bursting
into the kitchen like two small whirlwinds.
“There’s going to be snow on Christmas!”</p>

<p>As soon as lunch was over, the four little
Blossoms went out to play in the snow and they
spent the time till dinner teaching Philip to pull
the sled. The dog didn’t like it very well, but
the children had glorious fun and came in with
such red cheeks and such appetites that Father
Blossom declared he was almost tempted to go
out and play in the snow himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“And now we’re going shopping!” announced
Twaddles the next morning. “We have ever so
much money, haven’t we, Meg?”</p>

<p>“Is Meg the banker?” asked Father Blossom.</p>

<p>“She carries the money,” explained Twaddles.
“Dot has twenty-five cents and I have twenty,
and Meg has forty and Bobby has—how much
have you, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“Fifty cents,” said Bobby. “I saved it.”</p>

<p>“I could have earned ’bout fifty dollars, if
Mother would let me,” sighed Dot. “But she
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, Dot, dear, what are you talking
about?” asked Mother Blossom, puzzled. “How
could a little girl like you earn money?”</p>

<p>“Errands,” said Dot briefly. “Folks wanted
to give me pennies for errands every time; but
you said we mustn’t take pennies.”</p>

<p>“Not for doing little kindnesses,” declared
Mother Blossom firmly. “Just remember the
times the neighbors have given you cookies and
cloth for doll dresses, Dot, and sent you postal
cards from far away cities. I know you and
Twaddles are both glad to do an errand now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
then for the Peabodys and the Wards and the
Hiltons.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course they are,” said Father Blossom.
“And that reminds me, I have four shiny
new quarters in my pocket that I’ve been saving
for you children. Perhaps that will help you
with this Christmas shopping.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms were sure it would,
and when they started uptown soon after breakfast
they felt very rich indeed. Meg carried
the money in a beaded bag and Dot sat on the
sled. They were sure they would need a sled
to bring the bundles home on. It had stopped
snowing but there was a thick, snowy blanket
on every street and the sled pulled easily.</p>

<p>“How many presents do we have to buy,
Meg?” asked Dot, who certainly depended on
Meg for a great deal of information.</p>

<p>“Mother, Daddy, Norah, Sam, Twaddles,
Bobby and me,” counted Meg on her fingers.
“You have to buy seven presents.”</p>

<p>“Eight, counting me,” said Dot.</p>

<p>“You don’t buy a present for yourself,” Bobby
reminded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Oh, yes, that’s so, I don’t,” admitted Dot.
“Well, then does each of us have to buy seven
presents?”</p>

<p>“We’re forgetting Uncle Dave and Aunt
Miranda,” said Meg. “It wouldn’t be nice to
have them come see us Christmas and not have
any presents. That makes nine.”</p>

<p>Dear, dear, nine presents are a good many to
buy and it took the four little Blossoms several
minutes to decide how much they had to spend
on each gift. They sat down on somebody’s
doorstep while Bobby figured it out for them.
He said they must spend exactly the same
amount on each present because he couldn’t be
working out arithmetic examples all morning.</p>

<p>“Dot can spend five and one-tenth cents on
each present,” announced Bobby after much
hard work with a stubby pencil and a slip of
paper from Meg’s bag.</p>

<p>“I’d rather it came out even,” objected Dot.</p>

<p>“It can’t,” Bobby informed her. “That’s
arithmetic. Meg can spend seven and two-sixty-fifths
cents.”</p>

<p>“You can’t buy anything for that,” pouted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Meg. “I tell you what let’s do—divide up the
presents; you get one for Norah and I’ll get
one for Sam. And Dot can get something for
Aunt Miranda, and Twaddles can get a present
for Uncle David. Like that, you know.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms thought this was a
sensible plan, after they had talked it over,
though Bobby said he wished Meg had thought
of it before he done had so much arithmetic.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a present for Mother and
Daddy,” he added.</p>

<p>Each of the children were determined to buy
a present for Father and Mother Blossom, so
that was understood, too. And when they
reached the five-and-ten-cent store, they separated,
because Christmas shopping should always
be a secret. Bobby left the sled with the
boy who kept a paper stand next door, and
he was the first one through with his shopping.
He had to wait nearly half an hour and then
Meg and Dot struggled out of the crowd together,
their arms full of small packages.
Twaddles was the last one to come and he carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
one large bundle that was so big around
he could scarcely clasp his hands about it.</p>

<p>“Did you spend all your money for one
thing?” asked Meg curiously, while they piled
their purchases on the sled.</p>

<p>“No, the others are inside of that,” replied
Twaddles, gazing at his bundle with loving
pride. “But you can’t see ’em.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms ploughed home
through the snow and that afternoon they were
very busy, tying up packages in tissue paper and
writing names on the pretty tags and seals
Mother Blossom gave them. Mother Blossom
herself was busy doing up Christmas gifts to
mail and she had a whole sledful for the children
to take to the post-office late that afternoon.
Among the parcels were several for Aunt Polly
and one for Jud and another for Linda who
lived with Aunt Polly at Brookside Farm.</p>

<p>Tuesday would be Christmas, and Monday
morning Uncle Dave and Aunt Miranda came.
The four little Blossoms went with Father Blossom
in the car to the station to meet them. Meg
and Bobby had seen them once, when Bobby was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
three years old and Meg two, but, of course,
they did not remember them clearly.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” said Uncle Dave, when
he saw the children almost tumbling out of the
car to greet him. “So these are the four little
Blossoms, eh? What goes round and round
and never touches the sky or ground?”</p>

<p>“What does?” asked Dot who loved riddles.</p>

<p>“You do,” said Uncle Dave kissing her. “You
haven’t had your feet on the ground two minutes
since I first caught sight of you.”</p>

<p>Uncle Dave was a rather tall old man, with
slightly stooped shoulders and eyes that
twinkled whenever he looked at anyone. He
wore a soft felt hat with a high crown and a
narrow, curving brim. Out of the pocket of
his overcoat peeped a corncob pipe. Uncle
Dave was very fond of his old cob pipe, the children
soon discovered.</p>

<p>Aunt Miranda was a tiny little old lady with
snow white hair and snapping black eyes. She
was so muffled up in shawls and scarfs and capes
that no one realized how tiny she was till she
was all “unwound,” as Bobby said. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
thing she did when they had reached the house
and she had kissed Mother Blossom, was to put
on a black silk apron and take her knitting out
of the pocket. And during her visit no one ever
saw Aunt Miranda without her knitting. She
did not believe in idle hands.</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms always trimmed their
own Christmas tree, and right after lunch they
went to work. Uncle Dave insisted on helping
and he was so tall and had such long arms that
he was every bit as good as a step-ladder. How
he laughed when Twaddles, watching him admiringly,
told him this.</p>

<p>“I must tell Aunt Miranda that,” he chuckled.
“She always says I put things out of her reach.
She is so short that what I put away on the closet
shelves, she has to stand on a chair to get down.”</p>

<p>The tree looked beautiful when it was all
trimmed. Meg and Dot had strung the ropes
of popcorn and the cranberries and Bobby and
Uncle Dave had put on the gold and silver
ornaments which were carefully saved from
year to year. Twaddles always claimed the
right to sprinkle the white cotton and mica on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
for the snow, and just before dinner Father
Blossom put the star at the top of the tree and
Sam Layton came in to fix the electric lights.
Norah had baked the gingerbread men which
hung from the branches, and Mother Blossom
and Aunt Miranda had made the candied apples
on sticks which helped to trim the tree.
All the Blossom family had a hand in getting
the tree ready, you see, which was one reason,
perhaps, they always loved to have one.</p>

<p>“Now we light it after dinner, and put all
the other lights out,” Bobby explained to Aunt
Miranda. “And then we hang up our stockings
and then we go to bed.”</p>

<p>And after dinner the tree was lighted, and the
four little Blossoms marched around it, singing
the Christmas carols they had learned. Then
Mother Blossom helped them to hang up their
stockings, four in a row, fastened to the mantle-piece—and
very long and black and empty they
looked, dangling there—and they said good-night
and pattered upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>Just before Mother Blossom tucked them in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
for the night, Bobby ran over to the window to
look at the weather.</p>

<p>“It’s snowing some more!” he cried. “Twaddles,
Santa Claus won’t have a bit of trouble
getting here; the roof will be covered with
snow!”</p>

<p>“If you hear him, you call me,” directed
Twaddles.</p>

<p>“Call me,” begged Dot sleepily from her bed.
“I want to tell him something special.”</p>

<small>CHRISTMAS AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHATEVER it was Dot wanted to tell
Santa Claus, he was not to hear it this
Christmas. When the four little Blossoms woke
Christmas morning, it was already light and
they tumbled downstairs to find the four stockings
bulging with knobby packages. They made
so much noise that they awoke everyone else in
the house and Norah served breakfast a half
hour earlier than usual.</p>

<p>“Could I open one bundle, Mother?” Twaddles
kept saying. “Could I open one bundle?
Just that little square one. That doesn’t look
exciting, Mother.”</p>

<p>“That little square one happens to be marked
with my name, young man,” said Father Blossom,
“and I don’t intend to have any surprises
spoiled ahead of time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>The Blossom family never opened their
Christmas gifts till after breakfast Christmas
morning. The children had their stockings and
that was supposed to keep them contented till
it came time to open the parcels; but often they
thought they just could not wait another minute
after the first peep at the little mountain of
white paper packages under the tree.</p>

<p>“I declare, Twaddles, you remind me of a
bumble bee on a hot griddle,” said Uncle Dave
laughingly. “I never saw anyone in such a
hurry to get through his breakfast; now I call
these hot rolls first-rate and I need another cup
of coffee, please, Margaret,” he added to Mother
Blossom.</p>

<p>“Dave, I think you’re real mean,” scolded
Aunt Miranda, but she spoke so gently, no one
thought she really meant to scold. “How can
you sit there and drink another cup of that hot
coffee when you know these children are counting
the minutes till they can open their presents?
It isn’t good for you to drink that much coffee,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t take the second cup,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Uncle Dave meekly. “I seem to have had my
breakfast, then, Margaret.”</p>

<p>“May we be ’scused, Mother?” shouted the
four little Blossoms. “Please, Mother? Is it
time to open the things now, Mother?”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom laughed and said they would
all go into the living-room and look at their
presents. And in ten minutes that beautiful,
orderly room was a sea of white tissue paper
and seals and string and pink and blue cotton.
How Aunt Miranda laughed when she unwrapped
one canvas glove!</p>

<p>“I couldn’t afford to buy two of them,” Dot
explained, “because I had to buy a present for
Mother and Daddy, too. But you can use one
hand, can’t you, Aunt Miranda?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, I can,” Aunt Miranda said
heartily. “I’ll wear it when I’m fussing with
my garden this spring, Dot, and think of you
every time I wear it.”</p>

<p>Aunt Miranda had knitted a lovely scarf of
brushed wool with mittens to match for each of
the children, and a tam-o-shanter hat for Meg
and one for Dot. The four little Blossoms were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
delighted with these, as they might well be.
Dot’s set was of scarlet wool, Meg’s was a delicate
blue, Bobby had brown and Twaddles’ set
was a light buff color. Uncle Dave had whittled
each of the boys a ship, and for Meg he had
made a little chain of curious wooden beads and
another smaller chain for Dot.</p>

<p>It took a long time to see all the presents
for there were a good many of them and everyone
wanted to show his gifts to everyone else.
Sam was very proud of the little diary Meg had
given him and he promised to write in it every
day; Norah laughed till she cried over the
cologne bottle Bobby gave her for he had pulled
the cork out to smell of it after he got it home
and the cologne had either evaporated or had
been spilled and the tiny bottle was quite empty.
But as Norah said, when she thanked Bobby, it
still smelled exactly like cologne. Twaddles
had bought a pocket-knife with six blades for
Uncle Dave and not one of them would open.
But Uncle Dave declared he liked that kind
of a knife because it always looked well and yet
there was no danger that he would cut himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Each of the four little Blossoms, with much
panting and counting of their pennies, had managed
to buy Father Blossom a present and another
for Mother.</p>

<p>“I’m so overcome I don’t know how to say
‘thank you,’” announced Father Blossom when
he had Bobby’s ash tray on the table beside him,
Meg’s red stickpin in his tie, Dot’s paper weight
on his desk in the den and the handkerchief
Twaddles had given him in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mother Blossom was delighted with the cup
and saucer Meg gave her and she declared that
the pin tray Bobby had chosen for her was exactly
what she needed for her dresser and that
Dot must have known she wanted another glass
dish. But when she came to Twaddles’ present
Mother Blossom looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“What in the world can this be?” she said,
unwrapping it slowly.</p>

<p>They all crowded around her while she undid
the paper and when she held up an enameled
pot, such as Norah used to boil the potatoes in,
everyone looked surprised. Except Twaddles.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it nice?” he urged. “Course it has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
little hole in it, but that was why I could buy it
for ten cents. It used to be thirty cents, Mother.
Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Why, Twaddles, of course I do,” said
Mother Blossom, kissing him. “I like it very
much and you must have loved me dearly to
buy such a large kettle. I’ll find some way to
use it, even if there is a little hole in it.”</p>

<p>After all the presents had been seen, and the
four little Blossoms had so many toys and games
that Father Blossom said folks must have made
a mistake and thought they didn’t have a single
thing to play with before, Mother Blossom reminded
them that they were to feed the birds.
The children did this every year, tying pieces
of suet to long strings and hanging these in the
trees where the birds could easily find them.
They also sprinkled plenty of bread-crumbs in
dry sheltered places, off the ground so that no
cats should bother the birds at dinner.</p>

<p>“The snow’s awful deep,” said Bobby, stamping
in from helping to feed the birds. “Couldn’t
we go coasting, Mother?”</p>

<p>“After dinner, dear,” replied Mother Blossom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
“If you went now, you would have to
hurry back. After dinner you may all go and
wear your new scarfs and mittens, too.”</p>

<p>Christmas dinner was a wonderful affair,
with a huge brown turkey and a plum pudding
surrounded by a wreath of holly. Philip and
Annabel Lee had an extra good meal, too, in the
garage where they preferred to spend most of
their time. Philip seemed to feel that he was
really Sam’s dog and Annabel Lee liked to sleep
on the old fur robe Sam kept especially for
her.</p>

<p>“So you’re going coasting, hey?” said Uncle
Dave, when after dinner the four little Blossoms
began to bundle themselves up and Bobby
went down cellar and brought up the sleds.
“Did you ever hear the story, Meg, about the
little girl who coasted into a snow bank and
wasn’t seen again till the next spring?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Meg, her eyes round with
wonder. “Was she all dead, Uncle Dave?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, I should hope not!” said Uncle Dave,
his eyes twinkling more than ever. “You see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
it was spring the next day by the calendar,
though there was snow on the ground.”</p>

<p>“Dave, you shouldn’t tease the children,” reproved
Aunt Miranda, coming into the hall
and knitting as she walked. “They won’t know,
pretty soon, when you are in earnest and when
you’re not.”</p>

<p>“I like to hear stories,” said Meg, pulling her
tam down over her yellow hair. “Don’t you
want to come coasting, Uncle Dave?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I’d rather stay home and smoke,”
replied Uncle Dave placidly. “I’ve had my
day coasting. When I was the age of Dot, my
father made me a sled and I went up on the roof
and coasted off the woodshed and was in bed a
week.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be putting such notions in the
heads of children, Dave,” said Aunt Miranda,
gently. “They’ll be wanting to coast off the
roof next.”</p>

<p>“No, we can’t,” said Twaddles sadly. “We
haven’t any woodshed.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms had two sleds, just
alike; one for Meg and Dot and the other for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Bobby and Twaddles. Wayne Place Hill was
the finest coasting spot in Oak Hill and when
they reached it this afternoon, they found a
crowd of girls and boys already enjoying the
fun. Some of them had new Christmas sleds
and some, like the four little Blossoms, had sleds
that were almost new and some had old, old
sleds that were battered and scarred and tied up
with rope to make them last. And, strange to
say, the children who had the oldest sleds
seemed to be having as good a time as the ones
with brand-new shiny sleds.</p>

<p>Meg was immediately surrounded by little
girls who wanted her to “take us down.” Meg
was only six years old, but she could steer a
sled as well as Bobby and her small friends knew
it.</p>

<p>“Don’t take Hester,” said Marion Green to
Meg. “She always screams and makes folks
think she is hurt. And once she grabbed my
brother and pulled him right over backward.”</p>

<p>Marion Green and Hester Scott were both in
Meg’s class at school. Hester was a fat little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
girl and generally smiling. But now she looked
ready to cry.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been down the hill once this whole
afternoon,” she declared. “I’ll lend Dot my
sled, Meg, if you’ll take me down. And I won’t
scream a tiny bit, honestly I won’t.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take you,” said Meg briefly.
“Let Dot have your sled and she can play round
with it till I come back. She can’t coast down
alone either.”</p>

<p>Hester knelt on the sled behind Meg, and
Bobby obligingly gave them a send-off push.
The moment she felt the rush of air, Hester
forgot her promise.</p>

<p>“Stop it!” she begged. “Oh, Meg, please
stop. I can’t breathe! Ow! Somebody stop
us! Ow, we’re going to hit that red sled! Oh,
Meg, please, please——”</p>

<p>She flung her arms around Meg’s neck and
leaned back with her whole weight. Up came
Meg’s hands, the sled shot to one side and the
two girls tumbled off into the snow.</p>

<p>“I told you so! I told you so!” Marion kept
saying as she ran down toward them, and Dot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and Twaddles and Bobby came running, too.
“She always does that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t either!” protested Hester. “But I
couldn’t breathe or anything, and I was scared.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like a girl,” said Fred Baldwin in
disgust. “They always get scared.”</p>

<p>“Who always gets scared?” asked Stanley
Reeves, one of the high school boys, hearing this
sentence as he was passing the group on his way
up hill.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t think girls are all like that at
all,” said Stanley, when he had heard Fred’s
explanation. “I tell you what we’ll do—we’ll
clear the hill and let the girls have a race. Any
girl who is willing to steer her own sled may
enter. Come on back to the top and we’ll settle
this little matter.”</p>

<p>Fred Baldwin walked beside Bobby.</p>

<p>“Say, Bobby,” he said in an undertone.
“Palmer and Bertrand and I want to see you
about something. Can you come over tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Is it about the fire?” asked Bobby in quick
alarm. “Has Mr. Bennett said anything more?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Yes, he has,” admitted Fred. “I can’t tell
you now. You come over to my house tomorrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“You come over to our house,” suggested
Bobby. “Bring the boys. I said I’d help the
children start a snowman in the yard. We can
go out in the garage and talk and nobody will
hear us.”</p>

<p>Fred said they would come and then he hurried
on to watch the coasting race. But Bobby’s
pleasure in the sport was spoiled. He began to
worry again about the fire in the carpenter shop.
What had Mr. Bennett been saying?</p>

<small>MR. WHITE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">STANLEY was as good as his word and he
and several other high school lads kept the
coasters off while ten small girls, all who were
willing to try their skill at steering, started down
the hill when he gave the word. Two of them
capsized almost at once, three lasted half-way
down, one ran into a gutter and of the four who
reached the bottom of the hill safely, Meg was
the first.</p>

<p>“You’re the winner,” Stanley informed her.
“And I didn’t see any of those who fell off act
as though frightened. What do you have to say
for yourself, Fred?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, girls are different,” said Fred,
looking at Meg admiringly.</p>

<p>“But you said they always get scared,” insisted
Stanley relentlessly.</p>

<p>“I meant some of them do,” said Fred uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>And then Stanley took pity on him and invited
all the ten little girls to have a coast on his bobsled
which was certainly the largest and swiftest
sled on the hill.</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms left Wayne Place
Hill when the town clock struck five and all
the way home they talked of what they meant
to do during the holidays. That is Meg and
Dot and Twaddles talked, but Bobby remained
silent.</p>

<p>“I hope there will be skating,” said Meg. “If
there is anything I love it is skating. I don’t
know which is more fun, skating or coasting.”</p>

<p>“I like skating better,” declared Twaddles.
“Don’t you, Dot?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Dot, “I do. And I’m going to
ask Daddy to buy us some skates. I’m sure we’re
old enough to have ’em this year.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t either of you know how to
skate,” said Meg. “So how do you know you
like it better than coasting?”</p>

<p>They argued about this the rest of the way
home and were still at it when they trooped into
the living-room, where Aunt Miranda and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
knitting and Uncle Dave with his corncob pipe,
sat before the fire.</p>

<p>“Have a good time?” Uncle Dave asked the
four little Blossoms. “You did? That’s fine. I
don’t suppose you looked in the oven as you
came through the kitchen to see what we’re
going to have for supper?”</p>

<p>Twaddles offered at once to go and see. Aunt
Miranda was shocked at Uncle Dave and he sat
there and laughed so much Meg and Dot had to
laugh with him. Even Bobby smiled, though
he was still serious.</p>

<p>“What ails Bobby, Mother?” asked Twaddles
suddenly. “I guess he has something on his
mind.”</p>

<p>Twaddles had heard some older person say
this, but it was too near the truth to be comfortable
for Bobby.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, trying to look over Twaddles’
head, “Mother, is there any place in this
house where a person can think?”</p>

<p>“Just what I’ve often wondered, Son,” said
Father Blossom, coming into the room. “If you
find such a place, let me know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Supper’s ready,” announced Mother Blossom,
smiling, “and you’ll have to wait till afterward
to think. I know you children are hungry,
in spite of Christmas dinner, after all that coasting.”</p>

<p>Supper finished, Bobby forgot that he had
wanted a quiet place in which to think, for
they all gathered around the glowing fire and
Uncle Dave and Aunt Miranda told stories of
the Christmas days they remembered years and
years ago, when they were little. Some of the
stories were most exciting, and Twaddles’ eyes
were as “large as saucers” Aunt Miranda said,
when she told them of standing outside the
house when she was a tiny girl and having a
slide of snow from the roof strike her and bury
her out of sight.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to build a snowman,”
said Uncle Dave, the story apparently
reminding him of snow figures. “Didn’t I hear
something about a snowman yesterday?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to build him tomorrow morning,”
replied Meg. “Can’t we, Mother? Just
you wait till you see him, Uncle Dave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Though the children went to bed early so
that they might feel like getting up the next
morning and going to work at the snowman,
they did not begin to build him till after lunch.
Father Blossom offered to take everyone for a
long ride in the car as soon as they finished
breakfast and they did not get back till half-past
twelve.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’re going to build the snowman!”
cried Meg, hurrying into the hall for
her hat and coat as soon as they were through
luncheon. “You watch, Uncle Dave, and we’ll
build him close to the house; you can see from
the back windows.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come look after a bit,” said Uncle Dave.
“I have to have a little nap afternoons, you
know. Been working so hard this morning, I’m
all tuckered out.”</p>

<p>So Uncle Dave lay down on the big sofa to
enjoy a little nap and Aunt Miranda sat beside
him and knitted, while the four little Blossoms
went seriously to work to build the best snowman
they had ever built.</p>

<p>“We want him nice,” said Meg, beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
to help Bobby roll a snowball for his body.
“Uncle Dave is going home tomorrow. He
said so. And we want to show him we know
how to build snowmen.”</p>

<p>“I think he’s lovely,” said Dot, when Bobby
put another snowball on for the head and began
to make holes for the eyes. “Per-fectly lovely.
Daddy, see our snowman! Isn’t he nice?”</p>

<p>The car had stopped at the curb and Dot’s
quick eyes had spied her father. He came
toward them, around the side of the house, and
smiled when he saw what they were doing.</p>

<p>“Well, well, that is a mighty fine snowman,”
he said. “Mighty fine. What do you call him,
Meg?”</p>

<p>Meg was always expected to name any new
pet or a new doll, and why not a snowman, too?
The three other children looked at her confidently,
sure that she would be able to think of a
name.</p>

<p>“His name,” said Meg slowly, “his name is—let
me think a minute; oh, I guess his name is
Mr. White!”</p>

<p>Father Blossom laughed and kissed her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Bobby said he thought that was a splendid name.</p>

<p>“Are you going to stay home, Daddy?” asked
Meg, clinging to Father Blossom. “Or are you
going to take us somewhere?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” he answered promptly. “I came
home to get some papers from my desk and then
Sam is going to drive me over to Clifton; I’m
not sure what condition the roads are in and I
don’t think it wise to take anyone else. I’m
glad you’re having such a good time.”</p>

<p>He went into the house and came out the back
way again, in a few moments.</p>

<p>“Meg,” he called over his shoulder as he
walked to the car, “why don’t you get Mr.
White a hat to keep him from taking cold,
and a pipe to keep his nose warm? He ought to
have some comforts, you know.”</p>

<p>“Could we get him a hat?” asked Meg
doubtfully. “Oh, Bobby, there’s Fred and Palmer
and Bertrand. Don’t go off and play with
them, please; stay and play with us.”</p>

<p>The three boys came into the yard and Dot
disappeared toward the house. She had a way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of slipping off when she thought of something
she wanted to do.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s a pretty good snowman,” said
Fred, looking at Mr. White with great respect.
“I think he’s the biggest one I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s pretty good,” chimed in Palmer.
“Who built him?”</p>

<p>“We all did,” said Bobby proudly. “For
goodness’ sake, what’s that, Dot?”</p>

<p>Dot was out of breath from running and in
her hand she held an odd-shaped soft felt hat
and a corncob pipe.</p>

<p>“Put ’em on Mr. White, Bobby,” she urged.
“The way Daddy said.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that Uncle Dave’s pipe?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s asleep; he doesn’t need it when
he’s asleep,” said Dot.</p>

<p>So Bobby ran and borrowed a chair from
Norah and stood on it to put the hat on Mr.
White and place the pipe in his mouth. To be
sure he stuck the pipe in upside down, but no
one thought that made any difference.</p>

<p>“That’s great!” said Palmer Davis. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
looked at Bobby as though he were trying to tell
him something.</p>

<p>“You go over to the garage and I’ll be there
in a minute,” directed Bobby. “I have to take
this chair back to the kitchen.”</p>

<p>The three boys went off to the garage
whistling and Bobby climbed back on the chair
to fix Mr. White’s hat more firmly, wondering
what in the world they wanted to say to him.</p>

<p>“Lend me your necktie, Twaddles,” he said
suddenly. “Who ever heard of a man without
a necktie?”</p>

<p>Twaddles took off his red tie and gave it to
Bobby who tied it around the snowman’s neck
in a twinkling. And then, before he could get
down from the chair, the four little Blossoms
heard Aunt Miranda calling. She had come
out on the back porch with an apron thrown
around her head to keep her from taking cold.</p>

<p>“Meg, Meg,” she called. “Have you seen
anything of Uncle Dave’s hat? And his pipe is
gone, too. He can’t remember what he did
with that.”</p>

<p>Meg looked at Dot and Dot looked at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
sky. But before anyone could say a word, Aunt
Miranda saw Mr. White and his hat and pipe.
How she did laugh! She ran into the house to
tell Uncle Dave to come and look, and he came
to the door and Norah, too. Uncle Dave had
finished his nap and decided to come out and see
what the children were doing and that was when
he missed his hat and pipe.</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t think of disturbing a gentleman
who needs ’em worse than I do,” he said
merrily. “Leave ’em be till tonight, and let
your father see how you’ve taken his advice. I
don’t want the hat till after supper, anyway.”</p>

<p>Leaving Meg and the twins to admire their
snowman, Bobby dashed off to the garage. He
felt that he could not wait another moment to
hear what the boys wanted to tell him. They
were waiting for him with sober faces and Fred
looked around as though he feared someone
might be listening, as he whispered, “I heard
that Mr. Bennett wants to have us all arrested!”</p>

<p>Bobby had not heard a word, but Palmer and
Fred had overheard two men talking in the back
of a shoemaker’s shop the day before Christmas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
as they waited for a pair of shoes to be mended.</p>

<p>“He keeps saying we did it, and he doesn’t
mean to wait much longer,” said Palmer. “Do
you suppose they’ll put us in prison, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” nodded Bobby gloomily.
“That is, if they catch us. Say, why don’t we
run away?”</p>

<p>This was a new idea, but the other three boys
liked it at once. Before they left the garage,
their plans were all made to run away that night.
There was no use waiting, Bobby said.</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you at the corner, at ten o’clock,”
he said. “And we can’t carry much baggage.
We can’t run with a trunk, and we may have to
run.”</p>

<p>“Do we say good-bye to anyone?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Not a single person,” said Bobby, “Not
even your mother. And remember not to bang
the front door. Daddy is going to lodge meeting
tonight, I think, so I can get away easily.”</p>

<p>After the boys had gone, Bobby did not go
back to where Meg and the twins were playing
with Mr. White. Instead he went upstairs and
began to pack. He spread out a clean handkerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
on the window sill in his room and in it he
put his pocket-knife, the one Twaddles always
wanted to borrow, two gum drops that were so
hard he had never expected to eat them, the
watch spring Uncle Dave had given him and
which he meant to use in an “invention” some
day, and a piece of soft, kneaded rubber. These
were the things he liked best and he thought
they would all be useful on a journey.</p>

<p>“What red cheeks Bobby has!” said Mother
Blossom at dinner that night. “I do hope he
hasn’t taken cold, playing in the snow.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” declared Bobby, wishing that
everyone would not look at him. He was afraid
they would see that he was excited because he
was going to run away.</p>

<small>RUNNING AWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS it happened, Bobby could not have
chosen a better night for running away.
That is, for running away without being found
out. Father Blossom hurried off to his lodge
meeting directly after dinner, and then the telephone
bell rang and Mrs. Ward, a neighbor who
lived near, asked Mother Blossom and Uncle
Dave and Aunt Miranda to come over to her
house and spend the evening.</p>

<p>“I ought to be packing our things,” said Aunt
Miranda, when Mother Blossom told her. “But
we’re not going till the eleven o’clock train, and
I suppose I’ll have time in the morning; I’d
like to go, Margaret, and so would Dave.”</p>

<p>That left Norah in charge of the house and
of the four little Blossoms, and she sent them
to bed the minute the clock struck eight. Norah
believed that all children should go to bed early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and it never did any good to coax her to let one
stay up a single second past bedtime hour. She
waited till they were all in bed, then put out the
lights in their rooms, raised the windows and
went downstairs to read her paper in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“It’s an awful long time till ten o’clock,” said
Bobby to himself, crawling out of bed as soon
as he heard Norah close the door at the foot
of the back stairs. “I hope I don’t go to sleep
before it’s time to start.”</p>

<p>Bobby had not meant to undress, for when he
and the boys talked it over they had decided that
the best way would be to go to bed fully dressed
and then pull the covers up and if anyone peeped
into their bedrooms they would look as usual.
But Bobby had reckoned without Norah who
announced that she expected to see clothes
“folded up as they belong on chairs and not scattered
all about.” Bobby knew that if Norah
went through his room and saw no clothes neatly
folded she would immediately want to know
where they were. So he had had to undress and
get into his pajamas as he always did.</p>

<p>Bobby had a small room to himself, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
twins slept in a larger connecting room and Meg
had her own little room.</p>

<p>“I s’pose Meg will be kind of sorry,” said
Bobby, trying to dress quietly, and without snapping
on the light. “But she would be sorrier if
I stayed here and Mr. Bennett put me in prison.
Mother wouldn’t like that, either. I wonder
what Mr. Bennett will say when he finds we’ve
gone.”</p>

<p>As soon as he was dressed, Bobby tiptoed into
Mother Blossom’s room to look at her little
ivory clock. It was only half-past eight!</p>

<p>“I wish I’d told the fellows nine o’clock,”
thought Bobby. “But there would be a lot of
people coming home from the movies then and
they might see us. I guess I can read till a
quarter of, and then I’ll go.”</p>

<p>He found a magazine on the table by the bed
and he took that and Father Blossom’s pocket
flashlight which lay near and went back into
his own room and lay down on the floor and read
the stories, not daring to turn on the electric
light lest someone come home and see a light in
his room when he was supposed to be asleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
He had to put the quilt over him, because, even
though he had closed the window, the room was
cold. Norah had carefully turned off the heat
before she went downstairs.</p>

<p>Bobby was so wide awake that he knew he
wouldn’t go to sleep and he was very much surprised
when his head struck the floor with a
bump.</p>

<p>“Why—I guess I went to sleep!” he whispered.
“I hope it isn’t after ten o’clock!”</p>

<p>He hurried across the hall to look at the
ivory clock. It said twenty minutes of ten.
Bobby’s heart thumped a little as he went back
to his room and felt around for the handkerchief
he had tied up that afternoon and hidden on the
floor of his closet. He found it and then crept
carefully into the hall, afraid that Dot would
hear him and call out. She was a light sleeper
and woke easily.</p>

<p>“I’ll slide down the banisters,” he decided
when he reached the stairs. “Then the stairs
can’t creak and make a noise.”</p>

<p>Once in the downstairs hall, it was easy to
get his hat and coat and rubber boots. A light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
shone under the kitchen door, proof that Norah
was still there. Probably she would sit up till
Mother Blossom came home. Bobby let himself
out of the front door and closed it very gently.
Then he was possessed to run around to the back
of the house and make sure that Norah had not
taken it into her head to go upstairs and look for
him.</p>

<p>“Oh—my!” gasped Bobby with a half grunt
as he turned the corner of the house. He had
walked into Mr. White, whose existence he had
forgotten. There was no moon and the dark
was pretty black until one got used to it.</p>

<p>Bobby walked around the snowman and then
he could see the light streaming from the kitchen
windows. Norah seldom pulled down the
shades. He could see her sitting at the table,
her paper propped up against her mending basket.
Sam sat on the other side of the table, reading
a book. Philip was stretched out before
the fire, and Annabel Lee dozed in a cushioned
rocking chair.</p>

<p>“Sam could take us in the car,” thought
Bobby, carefully picking his way out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
yard. “He could take us to—to Mexico, I
guess! But he’d want to tell Daddy first, and
Daddy wouldn’t let us go, maybe.”</p>

<p>There were not many street lights in Oak Hill
and the street where the Blossoms lived was not
much traveled after dark. So Bobby had to go
slowly, feeling his way till he reached the corner
where an arc light burned.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bobby!” whispered a voice, and Fred
Baldwin stepped out of the shadows. Palmer
Davis was behind him.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bertrand?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t come yet—he’s always late,” said
Fred, who thought that everyone should be as
prompt as he was.</p>

<p>“Maybe he can’t get away,” said Palmer
mildly. “My mother most caught me as I was
going out the door. Suppose she had!”</p>

<p>“Your father go to lodge meeting?” Fred
asked Bobby. “So’d mine and Palmer’s too,
and I think Bertrand’s father was going. Wonder
where he is now.”</p>

<p>Fred meant Bertrand, not his father, and just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
as he finished speaking, that small boy came up
to them, panting.</p>

<p>“I ran all the way,” he said. “Is it late? My
mother had company in the parlor and my big
sister was making candy in the kitchen. So I
couldn’t get out till I thought of sliding down
the porch trellis.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it icy?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it was icy,” admitted Bertrand
cheerfully. “But I don’t care, long as I got
here!”</p>

<p>“Where we going?” asked Fred, looking at
Bobby for directions.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better walk till we come to a
barn,” planned Bobby. “Folks always sleep in
a barn when they run away from home.”</p>

<p>“Where’ll we get anything to eat?” suggested
Palmer Davis. “I’m hungry already.”</p>

<p>“I brought some buns,” said Bertrand, hastily
untying a small package he carried. “We can
eat these as we go along.”</p>

<p>They started to walk uptown, keeping close
together and munching the buns as they walked.
The packed snow deadened the noise of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
footfalls and there was not a sound anywhere.
Here and there a light shone out from the
houses they passed, but most folk in Oak Hill
went to bed before ten o’clock unless there happened
to be a party.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bennett has a watchman all night at the
shop,” said Bertrand presently. “I saw him
when I came out of our house. He has a little
shanty to stay in and a stove to keep him warm.”</p>

<p>“What’s he supposed to do?” asked Bobby,
wishing that everything didn’t look so queer and
spooky at night.</p>

<p>“Why, the grocery boy says Mr. Bennett is
trying to get more insurance and he won’t have
anything touched till that’s settled,” explained
Bertrand, who certainly heard everything that
was ever said anywhere in his vicinity. “He
thinks we’ll come pawing over the ruins, the
grocery boy says.”</p>

<p>They had reached the business section of the
town now and Bobby, looking ahead, made out
the dim outline of a figure coming toward them.
They would meet under the next arc light, unless
the boys could hide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Sh—there’s somebody coming!” he whispered.
“We don’t want ’em to see us. Let’s
cross over to the other side.”</p>

<p>“That’ll look funny,” objected Fred. “Just
walk ahead and don’t say anything or look up;
nobody will know us.”</p>

<p>Alas for Fred’s hope! To Bobby’s terror and
despair, as he was doggedly tramping past the
stranger, his coat collar turned up and his hands
deep in his pockets, he felt a grasp on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Robert!” said Father Blossom’s voice
sternly, “what are you doing out here at this
time of night?”</p>

<p>The boys stopped as if they had been shot, and
poor Bobby turned furiously on Fred.</p>

<p>“I <i>told</i> you we ought to have crossed over,”
he said angrily. “Now see what you’ve done!”</p>

<p>“But what are you doing?” asked Father
Blossom. “That’s more important. Does
Mother know where you are, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly,” admitted Bobby.</p>

<p>“I’ve just left your father, Fred,” said Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Blossom, recognizing Fred in the dim light.
“Does he know you are uptown?”</p>

<p>Fred stood on one foot and then the other and
finally muttered that he supposed he didn’t.</p>

<p>Father Blossom touched the knotted handkerchief
Bobby carried, gently.</p>

<p>“What is this, Son?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Things,” said Bobby uncomfortably. “My
knife and the kneaded rubber, and—and some
more things.”</p>

<p>“Are you running away?” said Father Blossom
and the suddenness of the question took
Bobby by surprise. The other boys stared in
astonishment at Bobby’s father. How in the
world had he managed to guess so quickly?</p>

<p>“I see you are,” said Father Blossom, as no
one answered. “And what are you running
away from, boys?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bennett,” said Bobby jerkily. “He says
he’s going to have us arrested.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll have to go to prison,” put in Palmer
Davis.</p>

<p>Father Blossom looked at the circle of worried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
little faces and smiled. Then he became
very grave.</p>

<p>“I doubt very much if Mr. Bennett will have
you arrested,” he said. “I have heard a new
story tonight that puts the blame on some
tramps seen hanging around the shop after you
boys went in to get your ball. There is too much
doubt about the affair for Mr. Bennett to risk
getting out warrants. But, suppose he did: do
you think I want my son, and would your fathers
want you, to run away instead of facing this
trouble and seeing it through?”</p>

<p>“But I thought you wouldn’t like me to be
arrested,” cried Bobby. “And all the girls in
school would tease Meg.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you arrested,” said Father Blossom
earnestly, “and Meg would feel very bad
if that should happen and so would Mother.
But, Bobby, that would be something you could
not help. People can not help getting into
trouble sometimes, but they can always help
being afraid. You are running away because
you are afraid of what may happen.”</p>

<p>Bobby and the other boys were silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“A good soldier always faces the music,” said
Father Blossom. “Surely you are not going
to turn your backs and run?”</p>

<p>Bobby looked from Palmer to Fred and then
at Bertrand. They looked gloomy but not
frightened.</p>

<p>“All right,” sighed Bobby, “we’ll go back.
Nobody can say we are cowards.”</p>

<small>CHARLOTTE GORDON’S PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UNCLE DAVE and Aunt Miranda went
home the next morning. They did not
know that Bobby had almost run away. Neither
did Meg and the twins. Mother Blossom knew,
for Father Blossom told her. But she only
hugged Bobby when she came into his room to
call him the next morning and whispered that
he must never think of running away and leaving
her, no matter what happened.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get along without my big boy,” she
said earnestly.</p>

<p>Bobby and Father Blossom had reached
home before Mother Blossom and Uncle Dave
and Aunt Miranda came in from Mrs. Ward’s,
so Bobby had been spared any explanations. He
himself told Meg several weeks afterward and
she was much surprised to hear what he had
planned to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>The carpenter apparently had not made up
his mind that the boys were responsible for
the destruction of his shop, for he caused no
arrests to be made. Father Blossom and Fred’s
father found out that one of the tramps seen
around the shop was supposed to have once
worked for Mr. Bennett, but beyond that they
could not get a description of the men.</p>

<p>“But if they set fire to the shop, we’ll find
them,” said Father Blossom. “You tell the boys
to stop worrying over this, Bobby. No one is
going to do anything to you, and sooner or later
you’ll hear that Mr. Bennett has discovered who
burned down his shop.”</p>

<p>A cold snap that brought wonderful skating
helped Bobby and his chums to forget their
troubles. And when Charlotte Gordon, one of
the girls in Bobby’s class at school, sent out invitations
for a New Year’s party, they were sure
that nothing could ever bother them again.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she nice to ask me!” exclaimed Meg,
when she came home from the ice pond one
afternoon to find two square pink invitations on
the hall table, one addressed to Bobby and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
to herself. “Hester Scott told me this morning
that she invited all your class, Bobby, but I’m
in the next grade. Hester didn’t get an invitation.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Charlotte thought it would be nice
to ask you, because of Bobby,” said Mother
Blossom. “When I was a little girl I always
went to parties with my brother.”</p>

<p>“But she forgot us!” chorused the twins excitedly.
“Can’t we go, Mother? Maybe Charlotte
didn’t know about us.”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom laughed and said she thought
that Charlotte knew about Dot and Twaddles.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have much fun at this party,
dears,” she told the disappointed youngsters.
“The children who are asked are several years
older than you; I’ll tell you what we’ll do when
Meg and Bobby go to the party. We’ll have
one of our own. Dot may set the dolls’ table and
Norah will give her something good to eat and
I will come upstairs and play with you myself.
How will that please you?”</p>

<p>The twins loved to have Mother Blossom
play with them and they did not mind about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
party with such a pleasant day to look forward
to. Although New Year’s Day was nearly a
week off, Dot teased Norah to tell her what
they could have to eat and Twaddles helped to
set the doll table so many times that he broke
two of the cups and saucers.</p>

<p>“Going to Charlotte Gordon’s party?” asked
Fred Baldwin when he met Bobby in the grocery
store the morning after the invitations had been
sent out. “You are? So’m I. But what do you
think, she’s asked Tim Roon and Charlie Black.
I wouldn’t have them at my birthday party last
summer; they’re too mean to invite to a party,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Charlotte is polite ’cause she is a
girl,” ventured Bobby.</p>

<p>“Shucks, it’s just because they’re in our class,”
retorted Fred. “She could have left them out, as
well as not. But she invited every single boy
and girl. Meg’s the only one asked outside the
class.”</p>

<p>Meg was much pleased when she heard this.</p>

<p>“I think Charlotte is lovely,” she said. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
why shouldn’t she invite Tim Roon and Charlie
Black? I guess they like to go to parties.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope they know how to act,” remarked
Bobby. “But I don’t believe they do.”</p>

<p>New Year’s Day finally came—though Meg
and Bobby thought it never would—and in the
afternoon they went gaily off to Charlotte’s
party. Very nice they looked, too, Meg in a
white wool frock and wearing blue hair-ribbons
and her beloved blue locket which she had lost
and found the winter before. Bobby wore his
best suit and shiny patent leather shoes.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a party, too!” the twins
called after them, and Meg and Bobby turned to
wave their hands to show that they understood.</p>

<p>Charlotte Gordon lived in the largest house
in Oak Hill. The Gordons had moved to Oak
Hill from Chicago and everyone liked them for,
although they had a great deal of money and
kept three cars and a staff of servants, Mrs.
Gordon did not forget or try to make other people
forget that her father had kept the grocery
store in Oak Hill for years and that she had gone
to school with many of the Oak Hill folk. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
sent her daughter to the same school now, and
Charlotte was a lovely little girl, dark-eyed and
pretty and with her mother’s own charming
manners and way of keeping friends.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you could come,” said Mrs. Gordon
kissing Meg as she met her in the hall.
“Charlotte will show you where to put your
things, dear. Bobby, you’ll find some of the
boys upstairs who will tell you where to go.”</p>

<p>Upstairs in Charlotte’s room Meg found a
little group of girls shaking out their hair-ribbons
and comparing dresses and slippers.</p>

<p>“What a darling locket!” said Eleanor Gray,
when Meg took off her coat. “I never saw one
like it.”</p>

<p>“It belonged to my great-aunt Dorothy,” explained
Meg. “My Aunt Polly gave it to me.
I love it because it’s blue.”</p>

<p>In a room across the hall, Bobby found the
boys. He knew them all because he saw them
every day in school. Fred and Bertrand and
Palmer were there and Tim Roon and Charlie
Black who were already trying to do hand-springs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
over the beautiful carved mahogany bed
with its blue satin cover.</p>

<p>“Come on downstairs and don’t act foolish,”
growled Palmer, as Tim landed in the center of
the bed. “That’s no way to behave at a party.”</p>

<p>“I guess I know how to act as well as you do,”
retorted Tim. “But I’m ready to go down.
I want to tell Mrs. Gordon to have the fire extinguishers
ready in case of a fire.”</p>

<p>Bobby colored angrily, but Fred pinched him
to remind him to keep still.</p>

<p>“Wait till we get him outside, and we can
punch him,” whispered Fred. “But I don’t
think it would be very nice to start a row in
here.”</p>

<p>Bobby didn’t think so, either, and with an
effort he kept from “talking back” to Tim.
Everyone went downstairs and Mrs. Gordon
announced that they would have a Virginia reel
first.</p>

<p>“Everyone can dance that,” she said. “I’ll
play for you. And you must keep your partners
for the first game.”</p>

<p>To Meg’s surprise, and small pleasure, Tim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
Roon asked her to dance with him. She wanted
Bobby for her partner for she did not know how
to dance well, but Meg was a polite little girl
and she did not know how to refuse Tim without
offending him. She did not enjoy the reel very
much, though, for Tim was clumsy and stepped
on her feet often and besides he tormented her
by twitching her hair-ribbon whenever he
thought no one would see him.</p>

<p>“Now we’re going to play a game,” announced
kind Mrs. Gordon when the dance was
finished. “Keep the same partners you had for
the reel, children. All sit on the floor in a circle,
and close your eyes. I am going to pass
something around and let you guess what it is
by smelling it.”</p>

<p>The children sat down in a circle, Tim on one
side of Meg, Charlie Black on the other. Mrs.
Gordon went around back of them and held
a small bottle for each one to smell. Such wild
guesses! Fred Baldwin thought it was camphor,
and Bobby was sure it was cologne.</p>

<p>“I think it’s vinegar,” said Meg when her
turn came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>She had guessed it and she guessed the next
test, also, which was a pickle cut up in tiny bits
so that each child had a taste. If you think you
can tell a pickle every time, try it some day
when your eyes are closed and you have not seen
what you are going to eat.</p>

<p>“We’ll let Meg test you for the sense of
touch,” said Mrs. Gordon, smiling. “Give
them something of yours to feel, Meg, and see
if they can guess what it is.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Meg unclasped her locket
and passed it around the circle. No one could
guess what it was. Tim Roon was the last to
handle it and finally he “gave up.”</p>

<p>“It was my locket,” explained Meg dimpling.
And then Mrs. Gordon said they would play
another game.</p>

<p>This was to answer “Happy New Year” to
every question asked without laughing and they
had been playing several minutes before Meg
realized that Tim had not given her back her
locket. She waited till the game was over and
then asked him for it.</p>

<p>“I haven’t your locket,” said Tim. “I gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
it back to you. Have you gone and lost it
again?”</p>

<p>Meg was sure he had not given it back, but
she looked about the room carefully. She could
not find it. When they marched out to supper
it was still missing and she was afraid to say
anything to Bobby who did not like Tim Roon,
she knew.</p>

<p>“He might hit him, or something,” reasoned
Meg. “I <i>know</i> I didn’t lose my locket, but folks
might think I did. I lost it once and they think
I’m careless, I guess.”</p>

<p>She could not half enjoy the delicious goodies
and when they went back to play more games
after supper, Meg stole away by herself to have
a little cry. She had hidden herself in one of
the big leather chairs in the book-lined room
across the hall which was Mr. Gordon’s library
and she was sobbing quietly when suddenly a
deep voice said, “Well, bless me, and who is
this?”</p>

<p>A tall, gray-haired gentleman stood looking
down at her. Meg knew he must be Mr. Gordon.
When he found she couldn’t stop crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
he sat down and took her on his lap and by and
by Meg found she could tell him about the lost
locket and Tim and Bobby.</p>

<p>“And I did lose it once,” she explained, “and
perhaps I lost it this time, but I know I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You stay here,” said Mr. Gordon shortly.</p>

<p>He went away and in a few minutes he came
back and Tim Roon, looking very frightened
and ashamed, was with him.</p>

<p>“Tim has something to give you, Meg,” said
Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>Silently Tim gave her her locket and Meg
was so glad to get it back she thanked Tim as
though he had found it for her.</p>

<p>“If you don’t say anything about it, Meg
won’t,” Mr. Gordon told him. “I don’t like
Charlotte’s party to be disturbed and I would
rather she did not know what a mean boy she
has invited as a friend. Come, Meg, we’ll go
back before they begin to wonder where you
are.”</p>

<p>Bobby had been looking for Meg and he was
surprised to see her come in with Mr. Gordon.
It was almost time to go home and after they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
had unwound the spider web of strings which
brought them each a gift, the party was over.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll have a party every day in the
year,” said Palmer Davis, trying to be very
polite when he said good-bye to Mr. and Mrs.
Gordon.</p>

<p>“That would give us a gay new year, if not
a happy one, wouldn’t it?” Mrs. Gordon answered
him laughingly. “Well, you should all
be invited, my dears.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEG told Bobby about her locket as they
walked home and he was very indignant.</p>

<p>“Just let me catch that Tim Roon!” he said
wrathfully. “He’s always trying to bother
someone. I don’t believe you would ever have
got your locket back if it hadn’t been for Mr.
Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tim wouldn’t keep it—that would be
stealing,” said Meg who liked to think the best
of everyone. “He only wanted to tease me; I
know he would have let me have it after a while.
But I was afraid he would lose it or break it.”</p>

<p>New Year’s Day was, of course, on Tuesday
just a week after Christmas, and school was to
open the next Monday. So Meg and Bobby determined
to have all the fun they could before
they had to go back to lessons.</p>

is wonderful,” said Meg at breakfast the morning
after the party. “Better than ever. The ice
is eight feet thick!”</p>

<p>“Now Meg,” protested Father Blossom, his
eyes twinkling at her over the top of his paper,
“are you sure it isn’t eight inches you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it is eight inches,” admitted
Meg. “But that is thick, isn’t it, Daddy? And
Bobby and I want to go this morning, because
they say the high school crowd is going to skate
all the afternoon and we couldn’t have much
fun then.”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom moved the sugar bowl away
from Twaddles who seemed to want to pour
sugar on his oatmeal, and said she had a question
to ask Meg.</p>

<p>“I’ve often wondered, Daughter,” said
Mother Blossom, “who ‘they’ are; you’re always
quoting what ‘they’ say, Meg, and yet you seldom
use any names.”</p>

<p>“They are—they are—well, I guess I mean
everybody,” explained Meg. “Everybody says
the skating is wonderful, Mother. You don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
care if Bobby and I go this morning do you?”</p>

<p>“Let Twaddles and me go?” said Dot eagerly.
“Mother, can’t we go skating, too?”</p>

<p>Father Blossom looked across the table at
Mother, and laughed.</p>

<p>“Now the argument begins,” he remarked
whimsically. “A little more coffee, please,
Norah, to fortify me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, don’t let the twins go!” said
Bobby hastily. “We can’t have a bit of fun with
them around. They get in the way, and Twaddles
won’t stay off the pond, and they always
want to come home before we do.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re a mean boy!” stormed poor
Twaddles. “You and Meg are selfish. You
have all the fun—you went to a party yesterday
and Dot and I didn’t go.”</p>

<p>“No, but you had a party home with Mother,”
Meg told him. “Norah said you had cocoanut
layer cake and cocoa in the yellow pot.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we had a lovely party,” said Mother
Blossom cheerfully. “And twinnies, if you
don’t go skating this morning, I’ll think of
something pleasant for you to do in the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“It’s a very cold day,” said Father Blossom,
folding up his paper and taking his fur-lined
gloves (which Santa Claus had brought him)
from the window sill. “Quite too cold for anyone
to go out who doesn’t have to. I don’t think
Meg and Bobby will stay at the pond very long;
and small folks like Dot and Twaddles mustn’t
think of taking such a long walk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy!” cried Dot, disappointment in
her voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dot!” said Father Blossom, kissing her.
“Be a good girl, honey, and tonight when I
come home, we’ll pop corn at the fireplace.”</p>

<p>Sam brought the car around in a moment and
took Father Blossom off to the busy foundry.
Dot, with her nose pressed against the window
pane, was trying not to cry when her attention
was attracted by a farm wagon going slowly
past.</p>

<p>“What a lot of noise that wagon makes!” she
said aloud. “Why doesn’t the man oil it the way
Jud used to oil Aunt Polly’s wagons?”</p>

<p>“That wagon doesn’t need oiling,” Norah answered.
She was clearing the breakfast table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and had heard Dot’s remark. “Wagons always
creak like that in cold weather. You can tell
by that it’s a very cold day.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Meg bundled up warmly and taking
their skates from the hall closet, hurried off
to the pond. They promised Mother Blossom
to come home the moment they felt cold.</p>

<p>“The big boys will have a bonfire on the ice,”
said Bobby. “We can warm our hands there,
Mother.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go near the fire unless there are older
people around,” warned Mother Blossom.
“You can’t always tell what a bonfire is going
to do, Bobby.”</p>

<p>As soon as Meg and Bobby were out of sight,
the twins teased Mother Blossom to tell them
what they could do.</p>

<p>“You haven’t played school in a long time,”
suggested Mother Blossom. “Or don’t you
want to play school during the holidays?”</p>

<p>“We’re tired of playing school,” objected
Twaddles.</p>

<p>“You mean you’re tired of the old way you
play it,” said Mother Blossom. “I don’t believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
you have ever played you were a college
professor, have you, Twaddles? Take the old
glasses and pretend you’re a professor like the
ones who taught Daddy in college.”</p>

<p>“But what’ll I do with Dot?” asked Twaddles
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Why, Twaddles Blossom!” Mother Blossom
pretended to scold. “Dot will go to college of
course. Isn’t she going when she is a big girl?
You may be the professor and Dot one of your
students.”</p>

<p>“But, Mother, I don’t know how to play college,”
said Twaddles. “Dot doesn’t, either.
You tell us how.”</p>

<p>Mother Blossom thought a moment. She was
used to planning plays for the twins and even
Meg and Bobby sometimes came and asked her
to tell them “something to play.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you hold entrance examinations,
Twaddles?” said Mother Blossom, after she
had thought while the twins watched her anxiously.
“Play that Dot wants to come to college
and you must try her out and see if she knows
enough to come into your class. You might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
read aloud for him, Dot, and pretend that he is
a professor of English.”</p>

<p>So Twaddles and Dot ran up to the playroom
and got out all the toys without which they
thought they couldn’t play school. Twaddles
put on the big spectacles that had no glasses in
them—which were among his choicest possessions—and
Dot sat down to read to him.</p>

<p>Neither child could read, though they knew
their alphabet fairly well. But Dot had an excellent
memory and knew many stories that had
been read aloud to her, and now she opened a
book and pretended to be reading from it to
Twaddles.</p>

<p>“Begin,” said the professor kindly.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” read Dot, “there was the
nicest girl you ever saw. Her name was Cinderella.
Her sisters were so mean to her she said
‘I won’t stay with you any more’ and she ran
away. They wouldn’t let her go skating with
them,” added Dot, glancing up from her book
at Professor Twaddles, who nodded to show he
understood.</p>

<p>“Cinderella went on a ship across the ocean,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
continued Dot, “and the ship was wrecked in the
middle of the ocean and the wind blew her
ashore. While she was blowing through the
air she saw another person in the water and he
was Robinson Crusoe. ‘Catch hold of my sash,’
said Cinderella, ‘and I will pull you ashore.’
And he did, and they both landed on a desert
island,” and now Dot stopped to get her breath
and see what effect the story was having on the
professor. He was staring at her through his
glasses in amazement.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you mixing Cinderella up with another
story?” he asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Dot answered airily. “I
like different stories. Besides,” she added, “I’m
reading to you from the book.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the professor. “Excuse me; go
on.”</p>

<p>“As soon as Cinderella and Robinson Crusoe
found they were on an island,” went on Dot,
“they thought they would look around and see
if anyone lived there they knew. They went
to all the houses and rang the doorbells——”</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“How could they if it was a desert island?”
interrupted Twaddles. “Nobody lives on a
desert island.”</p>

<p>“Well, they did on this one,” retorted Dot.
“Cinderella was afraid to ring the doorbells,
but Robinson Crusoe went right up and punched
’em hard. And when the folks came to the door,
if he didn’t know them, he said he hoped they
would excuse him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they have doorbells, either,”
murmured Professor Twaddles, but Dot paid
no attention to him. She was determined to
finish her story.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon they came to a house,” she continued,
“where little Red Riding Hood lived.
She was very glad to see them and when they
asked her to take a walk, she said she would.
And they walked and they walked, and by and
by they came to a deep, dark forest.”</p>

<p>Dot paused and shook her finger at the professor.</p>

<p>“The Three Bears lived in that wood,” she
said slowly. “And they came out to eat them
up! The Big Bear said he would eat Cinderella
and the Middle Bear was going to eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Robinson Crusoe and the Little Bear said he
would eat little Red Riding Hood.”</p>

<p>“Did they?” asked Twaddles with interest.</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t,” replied Dot. “There was
a Fairy Tree at the edge of the wood and Jack
the Giant Killer lived inside it. He heard the
Three Bears talking and he jumped right out
of that tree and killed them with his hatchet.
And, after that, a ship came and got Cinderella
and the others, too, and took them home. And
they all lived happily ever after.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>MR. BENNETT SHAKES HANDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE Professor Twaddles could say
what he thought of this remarkable story,
the bang of the front door sent him and Dot
flying into the hall to see who had come. It was
Bobby and Meg who had come home because of
the cold.</p>

<p>“Hardly anyone at the pond,” reported
Bobby, blowing on his fingers and stamping up
and down to warm his feet. “Let’s ask Mother
if we may make candy.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms enjoyed a grand
taffy pull, and in the afternoon they played
“menagerie” in the playroom, using the animal
suits left over from the play they had given a
year before.</p>

<p>The next morning Father Blossom said the
weather was milder, and Meg and Bobby were
eager to try the pond again. The twins begged
so hard to be allowed to go, and promised so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
eagerly to do everything they were asked to do,
that it would have taken a harder-hearted
brother and sister than Bobby and Meg to have
refused them.</p>

<p>“Maybe next year we’ll have skates,” said
Twaddles as he pattered along, trying to keep up
with Bobby.</p>

<p>“Daddy was going to get you some for
Christmas,” explained Bobby, “but Mother said
next year would be better. You can watch Meg
and me skate.”</p>

<p>The pond was well filled this morning and
most of Bobby’s and Meg’s friends were there.
A blazing bonfire was burning down close to
the edge of the pond and the girls sat around this
to put on their skates.</p>

<p>“You kids want to stay away from the fire,”
said Stanley Reeves, skating up just as the four
little Blossoms reached the pond. “And if I
catch any boy taking a stick out to play with,
I’ll paddle him with it, sure as you’re born!”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed for Stanley was as good-natured
as he was tall—and he was the tallest
boy in his class in high school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“You think I’m fooling, but I mean it,” he
said seriously. “Fire is nothing to play with.”</p>

<p>“’Less you want to burn down a carpenter
shop!” shouted Tim Roon. Then he skated
away, with Fred Baldwin after him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you mind him,” whispered Meg to
Bobby, as they joined hands and struck out
across the ice. “He just likes to be mean.”</p>

<p>It did seem as though Tim liked to be mean.
He and Charlie Black, instead of skating off
with the others, hung around the edges of the
pond and tried to tease the younger children
who were amusing themselves by making slides
on the ice. There were half a dozen who had
no skates and these played with Twaddles and
Dot. Left alone, they would have had a happy
time, but Tim and Charlie continually tormented
them. Finally when Tim put out his
foot and tripped Morgan Smith, a boy about a
year older than Twaddles, for the third time,
that quick-tempered lad lost his last shred of
patience.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you!” he shouted, and grabbing a long
burning stick from the fire he started after Tim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>The other children scattered and Morgan, his
stick leaving a trail of fire behind him, was running
after Tim when Twaddles cried a warning.</p>

<p>“Look out! Stanley’s coming!” he called.</p>

<p>Morgan turned, but not quickly enough to
throw the stick back in the fire. Stanley skated
up to him and not even Mr. Carter, the twins
thought, could look more severe than he did.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, pulling a stick out of the
fire like that?” demanded Stanley. “Don’t you
know the little Davis girl was burned yesterday
doing that? I’ve a good mind to spank you
with that very stick.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Twaddles, who saw
Tim grinning on the edge of the crowd.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to spank Tim Roon,” said
Twaddles clearly. “He tripped Morgan three
times and he won’t leave us alone.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Stanley. “Well, in that
case I think I’ll excuse you, Morgan. But next
time you leave fire alone. And Tim, I’ll attend
to you if I hear you’ve been bothering children
younger than yourself again.”</p>

<p>Tim skated off muttering that “he guessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Stanley Reeves didn’t own the whole pond.”
Yet after that the children had their slide in
peace. Bobby and Meg called the twins when
the whistles blew at twelve o’clock and they
went home to lunch.</p>

<p>Mother Blossom said that no one should try
to skate all day, so Meg and the twins stayed
home in the afternoon. But Bobby was due at
the dentist’s at three o’clock. His teeth needed
cleaning only and he did not dread the visit to
kind Dr. Ward.</p>

<p>“Stop in the grocery, will you, Bobby,” said
Norah as he was leaving the house. “And
bring me a bottle of vanilla. I find I haven’t
a drop in the bottle.”</p>

<p>Bobby promised, and as soon as Dr. Ward
had finished with him, he crossed over to the
grocery store to get Norah’s vanilla.</p>

<p>“Heard about the tramps?” asked the clerk
who waited on him.</p>

<p>Bobby asked what tramps and the clerk
glanced at him curiously.</p>

<p>“Thought you’d know all about it,” he said.
“Why, the constable’s arrested two tramps he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
caught hanging around the railroad station.
Guess they were waiting for a freight—there’s
one goes through at two-thirty. They say one
of ’em used to work for Bennett, the carpenter,
and the other is a pal of his. Folks say they may
know something about the fire at the shop last
fall.”</p>

<p>Bobby took the bottle of vanilla the clerk gave
him and bolted out of the store without a word.
He ran all the way home and burst into the
house so breathless that he had to wait a minute
before he could speak.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother?” he asked Norah, who
came into the hall to get her vanilla.</p>

<p>“Upstairs,” she answered. “What have you
been doing, Bobby? Your face is as red as a
beet.”</p>

<p>Bobby dashed upstairs without answering,
and met Meg in the upstairs hall.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“Up in the attic, hunting for some red flannel
to make a new tongue for Dot’s teddy bear,” replied
Meg. “What do you want, Bobby?”</p>

<p>Bobby was already half-way up the attic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
stairs and Meg flew after him. Mother Blossom
and the twins were looking over the contents of
one of the rag bags in the middle of the attic
floor and they were surprised when Bobby
rushed toward them crying, “They’ve found the
tramps, Mother! They ’rested two of them and
one used to work for Mr. Bennett! The clerk
in the grocery store says so!”</p>

<p>“Why, Bobby!” said Mother Blossom, reaching
up and pulling her “big boy” as she often
called Bobby, into her lap. “Why, Bobby, dear!
Tell me about it, quick.”</p>

<p>Meg sat down on the floor to listen and Dot
and Twaddles hung over Mother Blossom’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about it,” said Bobby
excitedly. “But the grocery store clerk told me
the constable arrested two tramps this afternoon.
He said folks said they might know something
about the fire. And Daddy said so that night.”</p>

<p>“What night?” asked Dot curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh—a night,” replied Bobby. The twins
had never learned of his attempt to run away
and he did not intend to tell them now. “Daddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
said he heard two tramps were seen hanging
around the carpenter shop the afternoon before
it burned.”</p>

<p>“Ting-a-ling! Ting-a-ling!” the sound of the
telephone bell came faintly up the attic stairs.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer it!” cried Meg, jumping to her
feet.</p>

<p>“No, let me!” shouted Bobby, running after
her. Mother Blossom ran, too, and so did Dot
and Twaddles who thought this was all great
fun.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blossom wants to speak to you, ma’am,”
said Norah, as Mother Blossom reached the
first floor hall where the telephone was placed.
“He says it’s important.”</p>

<p>The four little Blossoms stood around expectantly
and listened eagerly while Mother Blossom
said “Yes, Ralph,” and “No, indeed,” and
“I’m so glad.”</p>

<p>You know how one-sided a telephone conversation
sounds. Finally Mother Blossom hung
up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Daddy says Mr. Baldwin telephoned him
about the tramps and that he is going with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
and Mr. Davis and Mr. Ashe to the recorder’s
office right away,” said Mother Blossom.
“Then, as soon as he has anything to tell us, he’ll
come home and we shall know all there is to
know.”</p>

<p>You may imagine how the four little Blossoms
glued their faces to the front windows to watch
for Father Blossom, and what a racket they
made when the car turned in the drive. They
were out on the porch in a minute, dancing in
the cold like four little wild Indians.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in,” said Father Blossom
laughing as they pounced upon him. “You are
not little Eskimos, you know. Yes, Bobby, I’ll
tell you everything in a minute. Let me get my
gloves off. Don’t strangle me, Dot; I need my
breath to talk with.”</p>

<p>As soon as he was settled before the fire in
the living-room, the four children sitting in a
row on the hearth rug and Mother Blossom in
her chair opposite, Father Blossom told them
what he had learned that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Mr. Baldwin telephoned me as soon as he
heard of the arrest of the tramps,” said Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Blossom, “and I came into town at once and met
him and Mr. Davis and Mr. Ashe at Recorder
Scott’s office. Mr. Bennett was also there. The
tramps didn’t seem to be bad fellows, only shiftless
and careless. One of them had worked for
Mr. Bennett several years ago.</p>

<p>“The recorder gave them an informal hearing
and though vagrancy was the charge against
them, he began to question them about where
they had been and what towns they stopped in
during the last few months. He surprised them
into admitting that they were in Oak Hill
around Thanksgiving time and though they denied
they had been in the carpenter shop, he
finally drove them into a corner and one of them
owned up to having slept in the shop the night
it burned. The man said they were cold and
they found the shop window open and crawled
in, meaning to stay till morning. They smoked
a pipe or two and then went to sleep. The
crackling of flames awoke them, and they found
the shop on fire. Though they were terribly
frightened, they were good enough to grope
through the smoke and heat till they found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
cat and tossed her out of the window. Then
they broke down the door and got out and ran
for dear life. Naturally they were not anxious
to be charged with setting the fire.”</p>

<p>“But if they were seen around the shop, why
weren’t they traced?” asked Mother Blossom.
“How could Mr. Bennett suspect five little
boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh, boys and mischief go together in some
people’s minds,” said Father Blossom, smiling
at Bobby. “And the tramps were sixty miles
away before morning. They caught a fast
freight out of town. But now everyone in Oak
Hill knows who set the fire, for good news
travels fast.”</p>

<p>Bobby felt as though a great weight had been
lifted from his mind. Back in his head, ever
since the fire and Mr. Bennett’s charge that he
and his chums were responsible, had been the
question: “Does everyone think I did it?”
Now he knew that everyone knew and, best of
all, he could go back to school with no fear of
being taunted with being a “fire-bug.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Will the tramps have to go to prison?” he
asked Father Blossom that night.</p>

<p>“No, not to prison, I think,” replied Father
Blossom. “It will depend to some extent on
Mr. Bennett. But no one can do wrong and
not be punished, Bobby. Sooner or later, we
have to pay for wrong doing and mistakes.”</p>

<p>Saturday Meg and Bobby went together for
the last afternoon of skating they could enjoy
before school opened. The holidays were almost
over. Bobby had his skates on first and he
and Fred and Palmer were racing across the
pond to see who could reach the other side and
be back before Meg should be ready, when
Bobby heard his sister give a little cry.</p>

<p>“Tim’s teasing her!” shouted Bobby angrily.
“Just wait till I get him!”</p>

<p>But Stanley Reeves had seen Tim skate up
and take Meg’s mittens which lay on the ice
beside her. He was a splendid skater, was
Stanley, and he easily overtook the grinning
Tim.</p>

<p>“I owe you one licking, Tim, and now you’re
going to get it,” said Stanley, dragging Tim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
back to where Meg and Bobby and the other
children stood. “Hand over those mittens and
say you’re sorry you took ’em!”</p>

<p>Tim mumbled something that sounded like
“sorry.”</p>

<p>“Ask him if he gave Bobby the coal for
Christmas in school,” said Bertrand Ashe suddenly.</p>

<p>“Did you?” asked Stanley, shaking Tim as
though he hoped by that method to shake the
truth out of him.</p>

<p>Tim nodded miserably.</p>

<p>“Then say you’re sorry,” ordered Stanley and
again Tim mumbled an apology.</p>

<p>“All right. And here’s something to make you
a better boy,” said Stanley turning the astonished
Tim over his knee. And, being much
older and a strong and athletic lad, he did
manage to spank Tim thoroughly in spite of his
shrieks and kicks.</p>

<p>Tim fled as soon as he was released and for at
least two weeks gave his schoolmates and teachers
no trouble at all. As Stanley said, someone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
ought to spank him often enough and he would
probably be a very good child.</p>

<p>On their way home from the pond that afternoon,
Bobby and Meg met the carpenter.
Bobby had not seen Mr. Bennett since the day
he accused him of setting fire to his shop. Now
he stopped and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Hope I know enough to say I was mistaken,”
he said. “Will you shake hands, Bobby? I’m
mighty sorry I blundered.”</p>

<p>Bobby shook hands with a beaming face. All
the way home he walked on air.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s nice,” he announced at dinner
that night, “when you know them.”</p>

<p>And here let us say good-bye to the Four
Little Blossoms.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
